41.0.A.0.jpg; Was that made out of slime? he looked down at the turquoise slime puddle in the distance.
41.0.C.0.jpg; Woah, there's so many yalus! the men stood in a line in the brown field.
41.0.D.0.jpg; Which one is the real me? take a guess. The woman stood and looked down at the spreading green goo.
41.1.A.0.jpg; It's time to finish you all! purple and blue orbs floated in front of him.
41.1.B.0.jpg; A thousand years. The man walked and held hands with the man with a white beard.
41.1.C.0.jpg; You. The man was in pain.
41.2.A.0.jpg; I'm done! mom, it doesn't seem like i'll be able to take care of you when you're old! the man smiled creepily.
41.2.B.0.jpg; Huh? the young man looked surprised.
41.2.C.0.jpg; Argh! the ground is splitting! the man yelled.
41.2.D.0.jpg; Earthquake? the woman and the bald man stood and looked concerned.
41.3.A.0.jpg; What's going on? he had a serious expression.
41.3.B.0.jpg; Woah! the man slid down the sandy slope.
41.3.C.0.jpg; Xiang ye, careful! the man reached out his hand.
41.3.D.0.jpg; Aaa. He looked upwards and yelled.
41.3.E.0.jpg; Xiang ye! a large rock fell towards the boy.
41.4.A.0.jpg; What's going on? the young man looked to the right.
41.4.B.0.jpg; Xiang ye is trapped under there! rocks flew in all directions.
41.4.C.0.jpg; A large rock formation stood in the fog.
41.4.D.0.jpg; Hmph, go die! the man looked down angrily.
41.4.E.0.jpg; The sword of destruction. The figures held their hands up to the sky.
41.5.A.0.jpg; Get ready. The bald man used his magic on the man.
41.5.B.0.jpg; A purple energy blast flew towards the man.
41.5.C.0.jpg; Steam cannon! the man looked determined.
41.5.D.0.jpg; Boom. A large grey rock exploded.
41.5.E.0.jpg; Fire! the hand glowed brightly.
41.5.F.0.jpg; The man charged up an energy blast.
41.6.A.0.jpg; Woah! the young man was blown backward.
41.6.B.0.jpg; I'm sorry. The man ran quickly.
41.6.C.0.jpg; The man ran forward.
41.6.D.0.jpg; A white circle swirled around the characters.
41.7.A.0.jpg; The man looked shocked.
41.7.B.0.jpg; Slime barrier. The man created a green barrier.
41.7.C.0.jpg; You're too weak to even use it properly! purple and pink lines shot from the orb.
41.7.D.0.jpg; Argggh-. The man winced.
41.7.E.0.jpg; Argh! my arm... Wahhh... The man looked up and cried.
41.8.A.0.jpg; My hand! arg! the man in blue armor lay on the ground.
41.8.B.0.jpg; What the hell is that thing? the man looked forward angrily.
41.8.C.0.jpg; A weapon. The woman held a sword.
41.8.D.0.jpg; Wh-what is that? the man looked confused.
41.8.E.0.jpg; Ehhhh? the man looked surprised.
41.8.F.0.jpg; Be careful. The robot hand pointed at the boy.
41.9.A.0.jpg; Stop! the man shielded himself.
41.9.C.0.jpg; The figure was in a cracked wall.
41.9.D.0.jpg; Wah! it's a ground dragon, run! the man ran away from the three people.
41.9.E.0.jpg; That's not a ground dragon! the man talked to the man with green hair.
41.9.F.0.jpg; Thin gray lines filled the background.
41.10.A.0.jpg; The character kicked a large stone.
41.10.B.0.jpg; What the hell is xiang ye doing? the woman looked down at the man.
41.10.C.0.jpg; A metallic hand broke through the rock wall.
41.11.A.0.jpg; The robot crouched down.
41.11.B.0.jpg; Crack. The pink circle cracked.
41.11.C.0.jpg; Tremble before me, the people of this world! the man held the joystick.
41.11.D.0.jpg; Have a taste of what it feels like when magic combines with modern machinery! the man grinned mischievously.
42.0.A.0.jpg; Thank you for reading, 7 billion views! the boy smiled and held a robot toy.
42.0.B.0.jpg; It's a giant! how are we going to fight that? the man looked anxious.
42.0.C.0.jpg; D-don't worry, i'm here! the man talked to the men in armor.
42.0.D.0.jpg; Mister yalu. The man looked surprised.
42.0.E.0.jpg; You were pretty cocky a moment ago. The robot stood on the sand dune.
42.1.A.0.jpg; That's xiang ye's voice! you're alright! are these the machines from the other world? the man with purple hair smiled.
42.1.B.0.jpg; Xiang ye, how did you make that? the young man smiled broadly.
42.1.C.0.jpg; The dwarves were constructing movable giants right before i left, but it doesn't seem like they ever got the hang of it. I can't believe xiang ye managed it... The man thought to himself.
42.1.D.0.jpg; Hehe! i just wanted to put my imagination to the test. The boy smiled.
42.2.A.0.jpg; I didn't think that i'd manage either! the man pressed a red button.
42.2.B.0.jpg; We'll call this thing 'lucky one' from now on! the male character smirked.
42.2.C.0.jpg; Two minutes ago... Mom, it doesn't seem like i'll be able to take care of you when you're old! i'm done! the boy stood in front of the man.
42.2.C.1.jpg; Lemme just remind myself of the inner workings! the man pointed at the drawing.
42.3.A.0.jpg; And now activate the fire-red crystal's power! the man closed his eyes.
42.3.A.1.jpg; The man's eyes glowed.
42.3.A.2.jpg; I'm not that interested in your past. The man jumped up.
42.4.A.0.jpg; Come alive! a bright golden glow appeared.
42.4.A.1.jpg; Lucky one. The man looked up at the glowing robot.
42.4.A.2.jpg; The ground broke apart.
42.5.A.0.jpg; I can build amazing structures if i combine the correct different types of stones in my forging process. The man looked to the right.
42.5.B.0.jpg; Hmph! you're full of shit. The person held green slime.
42.5.C.0.jpg; The man reached out his left hand.
42.5.D.0.jpg; Oomph. The robot fired a green beam.
42.6.A.0.jpg; Ewww! that's disgusting! the man looked up at the robot.
42.6.B.0.jpg; Shit, the thing is too big... The man yelled.
42.6.C.0.jpg; Let's try this for a change! the man shot a ball of magic.
42.6.D.0.jpg; Go! the man threw a purple and white orb.
42.7.A.0.jpg; A purple glowing energy orb flew towards the robot.
42.7.B.0.jpg; Careful! this stuff erodes steel! the man yelled.
42.7.C.0.jpg; The robot struck something with a purple energy ball.
42.7.D.0.jpg; The mecha's chest glowed yellow.
42.7.E.0.jpg; Lucky one is made out of fire-red crystals! the man smirked.
43.0.A.0.jpg; What? this thing made of fire-red crystals?! the man stared in shock.
43.0.B.0.jpg; Wah! a gloved hand pushed a red button.
43.0.C.0.jpg; A hand moved toward the men, and they ran away.
43.0.D.0.jpg; Ugh. The man looked up in shock.
43.1.A.0.jpg; Hmph, i'll find people who can defeat you! the man looked serious.
43.1.B.0.jpg; You are a very bad person. The woman walked towards the man.
43.1.C.0.jpg; Y-you first mine minerals within the mine without authorisation and now you want to harm a teacher of the royal academy. This is punishable by death! a blue blade was placed across his neck.
43.1.D.0.jpg; The boots pushed the man forward.
43.1.E.0.jpg; That means you're just as guilty as what we are! wahh... The robot grabbed the man.
43.2.A.0.jpg; You almost killed mr. Martin! the man faced the viewer.
43.2.B.0.jpg; Why don't we pay a visit to his highness? the blonde haired man fell.
43.2.C.0.jpg; I, i... The man looked down and sweated.
43.2.D.0.jpg; How much money does the purple dragon team give you? we can match the same amount that they can supply you with. A large mecha held a small man.
43.2.E.0.jpg; Why don't we collaborate? the man looked serious.
43.3.A.0.jpg; You've got thick skin for requesting something like that! the man looked surprised.
43.3.B.0.jpg; You don't understand the sheer size of the organisation that you're going against! the man stared intensely.
43.3.C.0.jpg; Hehehe... The hand held a glass of wine.
43.3.D.0.jpg; We have the regent to thank for our positions in this kingdom! the man smiled and held a wine glass.
43.3.E.0.jpg; That's right, that's right. The man smiled.
43.4.A.0.jpg; Hehehe... Member of the royal family. Tols busch. The man sat in the chair smugly.
43.4.B.0.jpg; Uh huh... Member of the royal family. Tols buno. The man sat with his arms crossed.
43.4.C.0.jpg; The members of the purple dragon team owe you big time. The men stood in a line.
43.4.D.0.jpg; Quick! bring the stuff here. The man yelled.
43.5.A.0.jpg; Please, take a look. The man gestured to the chest.
43.5.B.0.jpg; Why is there so little? the man looked forward.
43.5.C.0.jpg; We've counted the money and it's all there, we would never embezzle any for ourselves! the man smiled.
43.5.D.0.jpg; Brother. The person looked at the other person.
43.6.A.0.jpg; Why don't we raise the prices some more. The man smiled.
43.6.B.0.jpg; Sir, the prices are high enough as is, it might... It is a long term business after all. The man sat in a relaxed posture.
43.6.C.0.jpg; If we ask for low prices, we'll be missing out on all the extra money we could be making! the man smirked.
43.6.D.0.jpg; He's right. The man smiled.
43.6.E.0.jpg; Alright, increase the prices fivefold! the woman smiled smugly.
43.7.A.0.jpg; Those pathetic citizens are supposed to be supporting us anyways! hahaha... The man sat on the couch.
43.7.B.0.jpg; These guys are tougher than me! the man looked serious.
43.7.C.0.jpg; S-sir, i have news! the man talked to the man in armor.
43.7.D.0.jpg; What's wrong? forgery branch's martin and his students brought in a lot of gold alloy stones back from the mine! the man in silver armor talked.
43.7.E.0.jpg; Didn't we send yalu to deal with them? the man looked angry.
43.8.A.0.jpg; They have already restrained him! the man looked surprised.
43.8.B.0.jpg; What? the men sat on the couch.
43.8.C.0.jpg; West gate. The large wall stood tall.
43.8.D.0.jpg; Soldiers stood in a line, and a truck drove into the city.
43.8.E.0.jpg; Why are there so many guards? it looks like our actions have already brought in unwanted attention. The characters looked at each other.
43.8.F.0.jpg; Halt! the men pointed their spears forward.
43.9.A.0.jpg; Soldiers, i'm here in search of your team leader, please don't block our way. The man held onto the truck.
43.9.B.0.jpg; There's no need for searching. The man looked to the left.
43.9.C.0.jpg; Team leader sato and his highness are currently in a meeting. The three men walked down the path.
43.9.D.0.jpg; You must have a lot of balls trying to go against us! the man smiled widely.
43.9.E.0.jpg; Cough cough cough. The man was stuck in a door.
44.0.A.0.jpg; Martin, i thought you weren't capable of understanding the concept of current affairs, but it seems like you're just mentally challenged! seize them! the man spoke to the woman.
44.0.B.0.jpg; The men in armor leaned against the vehicle.
44.0.C.0.jpg; A boot was placed on the ground.
44.0.D.0.jpg; One step closer and i won't go easy on you! the woman held a sword.
44.0.E.0.jpg; It seems like you're here too. The woman talked to the man.
44.1.A.0.jpg; Prince, you seem to be directly involved with the price hike of these stones. The man gestured towards the woman.
44.1.B.0.jpg; Hmph. The man with red hair stood with his arms crossed.
44.1.C.0.jpg; I haven't been to classes these past few days, i was starting to miss you guys. People like you don't deserve to talk to me. The character looked down at the other character.
44.1.D.0.jpg; This bastard ignored me! the young man looked down in frustration.
44.1.E.0.jpg; Being with these fools will only lead you to your demise. The people stood in front of the truck.
44.2.A.0.jpg; But if you side with me, i'll provide you with wealth! the woman smiled smugly.
44.2.B.0.jpg; Who did you call a fool? hey! don't get overwhelmed eli. If you make a mistake here, you'll end up in prison! the man looked at the man with green hair angrily.
44.2.C.0.jpg; Martin, you've all violated military law, prepare to be questioned in court. The bald man stood in front of the truck.
44.2.D.0.jpg; Take them away. The woman smiled.
44.2.E.0.jpg; We heard nothing. Come with us. The group faced the woman.
44.3.A.0.jpg; Back off! the woman looked stern.
44.3.B.0.jpg; Ah! the man smiled.
44.3.C.0.jpg; It's sophisas! the person rode the white horse.
44.3.D.0.jpg; The girl looked down seriously.
44.3.E.0.jpg; The man looked stern.
44.4.A.0.jpg; The great wizard. The woman stood in the center of the group.
44.4.B.0.jpg; We're here dorona. The man and woman hugged.
44.4.C.0.jpg; I swill wanna kweep on widin de horsey thouwh-. The character spoke.
44.4.D.0.jpg; Can we ride the horse after we're done here? the person looked worried.
44.4.E.0.jpg; Hm, you said swo, i swill wanna wide de horsey afterwards! the woman smiled with her tongue out.
44.5.A.0.jpg; The man stood next to the woman and the boy.
44.5.B.0.jpg; Sophisas. The character looked stern.
44.5.C.0.jpg; This is purple dragon team territory, what are you doing here? his highness was informed that martin has broken military law. The man sat with a stern expression.
44.5.D.0.jpg; He's sent me to detain him! the man stood with his hand on his breastplate.
44.5.E.0.jpg; Are you kidding me? the man looked shocked.
44.6.A.0.jpg; He's currently being detained by the purple dragon team. You must be here because you want to release him! the man with red hair extended his hand.
44.6.B.0.jpg; Back down buri. The man looked to the left.
44.6.C.0.jpg; Rennes! the man looked to the right.
44.6.D.0.jpg; This was his highness' orders. The woman fell to the ground.
44.6.E.0.jpg; You're on their side too? the woman stared forward.
44.6.F.0.jpg; Buri, you've forgotten something important. The man closed his eyes.
44.7.A.0.jpg; The entire kingdom belongs to his highness. Do you still require further explanation? the man with red hair stood with his hand on his hip.
44.7.B.0.jpg; Rennes, we're all of royal descent, why would we call upon other people to do our bidding? the right character extended their hand.
44.7.C.0.jpg; If you accept the fact that you're of royal descent, then you should remember that i'm your royal uncle. The young man looked serious.
44.7.D.0.jpg; The man looked stern.
44.7.E.0.jpg; A real dragon. The men stood in the center of the frame.
44.8.A.0.jpg; The man fell on his back, looking shocked.
44.8.B.0.jpg; ! the young man looked worried.
44.8.C.0.jpg; Argh... My heart... Hurts... You don't have any boundary force. You'll struggle to handle his sudden release of force. The woman looked down at the man.
44.8.D.0.jpg; Rennes is really powerful... The man frowned.
44.8.E.0.jpg; Buri slipped up under pressure, please forgive us. That's right, that's right! argh- the man with spiky black hair grinned at the man with red hair.
44.9.A.0.jpg; Don't let the fact that angus is on your side make you feel invulnerable. I pay him equal amount of respect because he's my royal brother. The character glared at the reader.
44.9.B.0.jpg; But in my eyes, you're nothing but a scum of the royal family! the man looked down angrily.
44.9.C.0.jpg; I-i'm sorry royal uncle! the man cried.
44.9.D.0.jpg; A fool. The man used his powers.
45.0.A.0.jpg; Shit, i'll remember this rennes... The man let out a puff of air.
45.0.B.0.jpg; The hand pulled the woman's ear.
45.0.C.0.jpg; Oi you, you haven't come to class in ages. Where were you? argh! i'm sorry teacher! i won't do it again! the woman yelled at the boy.
45.0.D.0.jpg; Hey, go and help him out of this situation! why don't you go? miss dorona is scary... The woman in the white shirt ran away.
45.0.E.0.jpg; The man is a hero. The characters stood and looked forward.
45.0.F.0.jpg; Sophisas, please detain me. The man closed his eyes.
45.1.A.0.jpg; Martin, why are you being stupid? the young woman smiled at the man.
45.1.B.0.jpg; His highness would never have you captured! huh? so what sophisas said a moment ago was... The characters looked toward the center of the picture.
45.1.C.0.jpg; I'm just glad that you made it back safely. The young man looked down seriously.
45.1.D.0.jpg; We put you in a sticky situation again, sophisas. The man rubbed his hand through his hair.
45.1.E.0.jpg; The hand touched the person's head.
45.2.A.0.jpg; Let's not do dangerous things like this again. The man touched another man on the head.
45.2.B.0.jpg; I really don't want to see you die. The man stared intensely.
45.2.C.0.jpg; I-i understand! the boy smiled shyly.
45.2.D.0.jpg; Yi bei. The woman looked at the viewer stoically.
45.3.A.0.jpg; His highness is preparing for a large celebration. Every class has to choose their best student to attend. I chose you and rennes to attend. The young girl stood with her arms crossed.
45.3.B.0.jpg; What do you think? the young woman smirked.
45.3.C.0.jpg; What kind of celebration is it? the woman looked at the viewer with a slight frown.
45.3.D.0.jpg; Hey, rennes is already chosen by you. The woman with short brown hair stood with her arms crossed.
45.3.E.0.jpg; We need yi bei to represent the swordsman-ship class! she needs to represent the magic class! the character on the right pointed.
45.4.A.0.jpg; So what's your decision? swordsman ship class! magic class! swordsman ship class! magic class! the woman looked to the right.
45.4.B.0.jpg; Will you come with me to represent the magic class? the male character looked to his right.
45.4.C.0.jpg; I don't quite understand the current situation. The woman looked down with a confused expression.
45.4.D.0.jpg; Hmph.. The young man looked scornful.
45.4.E.0.jpg; Xiang ye, let's take a walk. The men stood side by side.
45.5.A.0.jpg; We can explain the situation to his highness. The young man looked worried.
45.5.B.0.jpg; Sure. When are you guys letting me go... The man looked at the man outside of the truck.
45.5.C.0.jpg; What happened? the man with the purple robe pointed towards the staircase.
45.5.D.0.jpg; The strongest. The man with the purple robe gestured with his right hand toward the left.
45.5.E.0.jpg; I see. The character looked towards the right of the frame.
45.6.A.0.jpg; But sato is currently the purple dragon team's leader. We cannot make any large decisions as is. The young man stood with a white robe.
45.6.B.0.jpg; I must first seek advice from the regent. The man looked up at the throne.
45.6.C.0.jpg; How the fuck is this kid the king... The man looked straight ahead.
45.6.D.0.jpg; Your highness, the purple dragon team raised the prices of materials within the city. The young man looked surprised.
45.6.E.0.jpg; Doing this also increased the burden on the citizens of the city. Is this really okay? the young man stood with a worried expression.
45.7.A.0.jpg; The regent said that current military budget is very tight, we should let it go for now. The young woman spoke.
45.7.B.0.jpg; Your highness, it would be beneficial if all this money went to the military. But what if it was embezzled by a corrupt member? the man with brown hair stood on the left.
45.7.C.0.jpg; I despise people who embezzle the most! the man with brown hair ran towards the doorway.
45.7.D.0.jpg; I have a feeling it's something more. The man with purple cloak pulled the man with brown hair.
45.8.A.0.jpg; The character stood with a white shirt and a maroon robe.
45.8.B.0.jpg; Shit! i shouldn't have said that... The young man looked over his shoulder.
45.8.C.0.jpg; Royal uncle, why are you here? the man in the purple robe looked towards the man in the red and black robe.
45.8.D.0.jpg; Your highness. The man with brown hair raised his hands in surrender.
45.9.A.0.jpg; I heard that there was some sort of conflict on the western border, so i came through to check up on what was going on. The men stood together in a hallway.
45.9.B.0.jpg; I just found out that the second in charge of the purple dragon team inflated the prices of the golden alloy stones and embezzled the military budget. The man looked to the right.
45.9.C.0.jpg; I have already sorted it out accordingly. The man was held in the air by chains.
45.9.D.0.jpg; I have a deep hate for thieves! the man looked off to the side with a serious expression.
46.0.A.0.jpg; 9. The woman looked to the right sadly.
46.0.B.0.jpg; The man with long blue hair looked at the man with a black shirt.
46.0.C.0.jpg; But... The man looked to the side.
46.0.D.0.jpg; Hm... The man looked at the viewer.
46.0.E.0.jpg; So, the prices of the gold alloy stones in the future... The man with the long red beard looked determined.
46.1.A.0.jpg; You're one of our most valuable assets mr. Martin. The bald man looked towards the right side of the picture.
46.1.B.0.jpg; Your students are also rather important. The man looked serious.
46.1.C.0.jpg; You are joking, right? the red-haired man glared at the young man.
46.1.D.0.jpg; This guy is probably the type of guy to kill me for making a comment like that from earlier! the brown-haired man sweated.
46.1.E.0.jpg; Your highness, i have a suggestion. The man with a beard talked to the man with blonde hair.
46.1.F.0.jpg; Please advice. The woman looked surprised.
46.2.A.0.jpg; Why don't we transfer the duty for collecting the gold alloy stones to the white dragon team and the forgery class? the man stood with his hands behind his back.
46.2.B.0.jpg; What? huh... ? the woman and the man looked at each other.
46.2.C.0.jpg; Regent, are you serious? the man with red hair looked to the right.
46.2.D.0.jpg; I'm aware that the stones still require further refinery. I already spoke with mr. Yalu regarding this matter. The man looked to the left with a serious expression.
46.2.E.0.jpg; The military budget... The man looked to the left.
46.3.A.0.jpg; Will now be the responsibility of the white dragon team. The man in the white robe stood with his arms crossed.
46.3.B.0.jpg; When was he this nice? is he just trying to be nice to sophisas? the man with brown hair raised his eyebrows.
46.3.C.0.jpg; Then let's do as advised by the regent. The woman sat and talked.
46.3.D.0.jpg; Martin, i would still like you to do something. Please inform, your highness. The man bowed toward the throne.
46.4.A.0.jpg; The regent would like to perform an excursion to the west. The festival will be postponed to summer.
46.4.B.0.jpg; I want you to construct an arena within ten days. Understood!
46.4.C.0.jpg; I didn't know the olympics were a thing in this world.
46.4.D.0.jpg; The men quickly walked up the steps.
46.4.E.0.jpg; Regent.
46.5.A.0.jpg; Your honour assisted us today. I still don't quite understand why.
46.5.B.0.jpg; Sophisas, you're my most important general.
46.5.C.0.jpg; You began as a front-line hero at the age of fifteen by slaughtering demons.
46.5.D.0.jpg; But then you were adopted by guro.
46.5.E.0.jpg; Don't you think your sword is lacking some action?
46.5.F.0.jpg; I serve his highness, and i do anything he asks me to.
46.6.A.0.jpg; I became the white dragon team's leader because my father wanted me to ensure the safety of his highness.
46.6.B.0.jpg; But i didn't know that your troops were situated within the white dragon team!
46.6.C.0.jpg; Hmph. The command of the country should be in the hands of whoever is the most able to lead it.
46.6.D.0.jpg; His highness is still too young. I need to do what's best for the country!
46.6.E.0.jpg; I agree his highness is young. But i think you should be running the country instead of abusing your powers!
46.7.A.0.jpg; Oh?
46.7.B.0.jpg; The man yelled.
46.7.C.0.jpg; Did guro not tell you the situation after he returned?
46.7.D.0.jpg; I still wanted to ask you.
46.8.A.0.jpg; what did you do to my father? he yelled. The man with the red cape flew towards the man with white hair.
46.8.B.0.jpg; Woah! they're going to start fighting.
46.8.C.0.jpg; Stand behind me. They're sure to hurt you if they begin fighting! the man quickly moved forward.
46.8.D.0.jpg; Leader! a beam of light came from him.
46.8.E.0.jpg; Something has gone wrong! the man looked down the stairs.
46.9.A.0.jpg; What's going on?
46.9.B.0.jpg; Mister guro... He hung himself in his library!
46.9.C.0.jpg; What? the man was surprised.
46.9.D.0.jpg; Guro, you really disappointed me this time.
47.0.A.0.jpg; The person wiped the silver blade.
47.0.B.0.jpg; She held a sword.
47.0.C.0.jpg; What's wrong? the woman looked at the man with concern.
47.0.D.0.jpg; You wouldn't understand even if i told you.
47.1.A.0.jpg; Don't misunderstand, rennes and i are only classmates. The woman held a sword.
47.1.B.0.jpg; What is it? nothing. The woman looked down at the man.
47.1.C.0.jpg; Fuck! he was only feeling down because of sophisas.
47.1.D.0.jpg; Have you decided on which class you'll represent for the event? i've decided to represent the swordsman-ship class.
47.1.E.0.jpg; Didn't rennes ask you to go with him?
47.1.F.0.jpg; You don't need to worry about how i feel! i wasn't mad or anything.
47.2.A.0.jpg; I just thought that rennes was pretty strong as is. I want to become his opponent.
47.2.B.0.jpg; Rennes is good looking! he can also handle himself! and he's part of the royal family! the man smiled.
47.2.C.0.jpg; He is quite attractive indeed... Yikes! the woman grabbed at the man.
47.2.D.0.jpg; Have you forgotten my true identity?
47.2.E.0.jpg; You're just human scum! i should be beating you every day!
47.3.A.0.jpg; No, please... The boy reached out.
47.3.B.0.jpg; Oof oof oof oof oof.
47.3.C.0.jpg; I'm so sorry, but i didn't know! i didn't know! the creature stood next to the cross.
47.3.D.0.jpg; Everyone stood in front of the grave.
47.4.A.0.jpg; Sigh, general guro was his highness' teacher. He also poured his soul out for the benefit of this kingdom.
47.4.B.0.jpg; It wouldn't have mattered that much if this happened to any other general, even his highness... The other generals are under the command of the regent. We, as people of this position, shouldn't badmouth anyone. Sophisas, if you want revenge, i will try my best to aid you!
47.4.C.0.jpg; Why don't you two forget about that? they placed their hands on each other's heads.
47.5.A.0.jpg; The regent is the strongest fighter in this kingdom.
47.5.B.0.jpg; When he was younger, the regent clashed with the demon king, george osa. He was the only person from the human tribe powerful enough to harm the king! hey, is she talking about your dad?
47.5.C.0.jpg; I heard my father speak of it before. He was the only human who escaped from my father.
47.5.D.0.jpg; He wasn't my father by birth. The man faced the younger man.
47.6.A.0.jpg; But he was my father who gave me a second shot at life. The man looked down.
47.6.B.0.jpg; The ayers wall wasn't constructed twenty years ago. My family is what used to be a small village in the south. Our family wasn't wealthy, but my father worked hard to put food on the table.
47.6.C.0.jpg; One evening... The village was raided by a group of bandits. The man rode his horse and villagers ran away in terror.
47.7.A.0.jpg; He was murdered by a bandit. A man yelled.
47.7.B.0.jpg; I'm not kidding. The woman choked the man.
48.0.A.0.jpg; Kill anyone who resists, capture the others! no! the man lay on the ground in pain.
48.0.C.0.jpg; The woman's face was covered in blood.
48.0.D.0.jpg; Father... The man lay on the ground.
48.1.A.0.jpg; After asking around, i found out that my brother was sold by the bandits to the demon tribe to be used as a slave. From there onwards, i learnt the sword, to find my brother. The boy sat on the ground, the man swung his sword.
48.1.A.1.jpg; At age fifteen, i asked to join the military. Kid, are you of age?
48.1.A.2.jpg; I am, commander! the young man stood in the room.
48.2.A.0.jpg; One day, my to be father came to check up on our squadron. The man looked around.
48.2.A.1.jpg; By then, i was already promoted to a front line fighter.
48.2.A.2.jpg; Please you guys... Finish me... The man pleaded. The man asked to be killed.
48.3.A.0.jpg; Finish... Me... Why haven't you relocated him to a safer location? where are you medics? the woman looked at the man.
48.3.A.1.jpg; t-the medics that travelled with another squadron got wiped out by the tribe on their way here. Sophisas, you're crazy! he was shocked.
48.3.A.2.jpg; He won't make it till the next wave of medics arrives. The man was worried.
48.4.A.0.jpg; Having him suffer would've killed him anyways, i just wanted to make it easier for him! you... So you're the one that killed the opposing commander, the child hero. I'm no hero, but i think i'd rather be called...
48.4.A.1.jpg; The empire's executioner. She held her sword.
48.4.A.2.jpg; Sophisas, how could you... He looked surprised.
48.4.A.3.jpg; If you hate fighting so much, why did you join the army? my brother was sold to the demon clan to be a slave.
48.5.A.0.jpg; After joining the battlefield, i found that no matter the amount of damage inflicted upon the enemy, my allies will still suffer great losses.
48.5.A.1.jpg; How can we allow for our comrades' deaths to be in vain? no matter what, your family is still in the hands of the enemy.
48.5.A.2.jpg; This soldier's name is roth. He was my underling.
49.0.A.0.jpg; If the higher-ups want me to use the people who have died as a stepping stone to welcome my brother back into the kingdom,
49.0.A.1.jpg; Then i'd like to give up. I'm tired, i'm going to go rest.
49.0.A.2.jpg; Do you want to violate military law by becoming an escapee? if we can change the way you welcome your family back into
49.1.A.0.jpg; Would you accept it? he stood in the room.
49.1.C.0.jpg; I was then taken by my father away from the frontlines. I then joined the white dragon team and continued my mission.
49.1.D.0.jpg; Father's ideal world was a place where every tribe would live in peace and unity. He stood in front of a grave.
49.1.E.0.jpg; And i too, became a follower of this train of thought. He looked down.
49.1.F.0.jpg; Creating peace is much more difficult than declaring war between the tribes. She had a serious expression.
49.2.A.0.jpg; The demon tribe was aware of this too. A truce between tribes would give all of us time to think of ways to move forward.
49.2.B.0.jpg; What's the plan now? he asked.
49.2.C.0.jpg; We can only try our best! he stood still.
49.2.D.0.jpg; One knelt before the other.
49.2.E.0.jpg; The tiger roared loudly.
49.3.A.0.jpg; He sat and stared intensely.
49.3.B.0.jpg; I must be getting old. He sat on his throne.
49.3.C.0.jpg; And that's how everything went down. He stood.
49.4.A.0.jpg; One walked down a red carpeted hallway.
49.4.B.0.jpg; You can leave. He rested his chin on his hand.
49.4.C.0.jpg; Understood. The creature spoke to the figure.
49.4.D.0.jpg; Disappear. The man walked, the other sat.
49.4.E.0.jpg; Royal father. She walked forward.
49.5.A.0.jpg; Did you bring the things i asked for? he clenched his jaw.
49.5.B.0.jpg; R. She stood ready, the other retreated quickly.
49.5.C.0.jpg; They lay on the floor, bleeding.
49.5.D.0.jpg; Oh guro... He looked down at the heads.
49.5.E.0.jpg; Since you couldn't be of use to me, then the only logical thing for me to do was to break your wings! he scowled.
49.6.A.0.jpg; I already organised for you to become an insert student of the archery class at the academy. Go and meet your new teacher tomorrow. One stood, the other sat.
49.6.B.0.jpg; I don't understand. She looked to the left.
49.6.C.0.jpg; A hand pointed to the right.
49.6.D.0.jpg; She threw the object.
49.7.A.0.jpg; I want you to join the class and represent it at the kingdom's sports festival. She looked at the paper.
49.7.B.0.jpg; And then, i want you to find his motive! he held a photo.
49.7.C.0.jpg; Old royal arena. A group of people stood in the ruined arena.
50.0.A.0.jpg; 10 40 817394849. She smiled confidently, he sat and sipped his drink.
50.0.B.0.jpg; Teacher martin has the pale moon stone. With something like that, building an entirely new arena shouldn't be too difficult. He spoke.
50.0.C.0.jpg; But how are we going to get rid of the old arena? and that's why i've brought mr. Yaso and miss aisi along to help out. He talked to the group.
50.0.D.0.jpg; Hey buddy, i haven't seen you in a while! he looked forward.
50.0.E.0.jpg; Hello teacher yaso. Eli has boasted about your forgery! he greeted him.
50.1.A.0.jpg; Mike, you can begin. She looked surprised.
50.1.B.0.jpg; Alright! he moved his arm, she stood ready.
50.1.C.0.jpg; He stood with his arms crossed.
50.1.D.0.jpg; Huff! he breathed heavily.
50.1.E.0.jpg; Just as it was about to hit him, he jumped.
50.2.A.0.jpg; He flew upwards.
50.2.B.0.jpg; He used a magic attack.
50.2.C.0.jpg; The end. He was angry, the other swung.
50.3.A.0.jpg; A tornado formed in the arena.
50.3.B.0.jpg; Three tornadoes spiraled upwards.
50.3.C.0.jpg; Woah, find cover! rubble fell, energy flashed, and they ran.
50.3.D.0.jpg; She stood in the darkness.
50.3.E.0.jpg; Barrier of everlasting lightning. She held the orb.
50.4.A.0.jpg; She held the orb, her clothing billowed.
50.4.B.0.jpg; An energy wave traveled through the hallway.
50.4.C.0.jpg; A blue and white light flowed through the hallway.
50.4.D.0.jpg; Swirls pushed against a white shape.
50.4.E.0.jpg; The sphere cracked and fell apart.
50.4.F.0.jpg; The building crumbled.
50.5.A.0.jpg; You are not a man, you're a god.
50.5.B.0.jpg; The characters stood in the mist.
50.5.C.0.jpg; This is probably one of the most effective demolition squads in this world. He was worried.
50.5.D.0.jpg; He kicked, one fell, the other fell.
50.5.E.0.jpg; You should have known better than to insult a witch. She stood, he knelt.
50.6.A.0.jpg; Contract. She cast a spell.
50.6.B.0.jpg; Don't be scared. The dome shook.
50.6.C.0.jpg; A single sentence.
