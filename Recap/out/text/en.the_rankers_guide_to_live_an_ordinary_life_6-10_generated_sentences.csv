6.0.A.0.jpg;  A call to action for support, Hunter Guild Babylon is plastered in a white box in the corner.  The building in the background towers over the city, a symbol of the guilds power.
6.0.A.1.jpg;  Two glass and steel buildings pierce the bright blue sky, the larger one a testament to ambition. 
6.0.B.jpg;  A young man in a suit laughs, covering his mouth with his hand, a playful "ha" escaping his lips. 
6.0.C.jpg;  The woman holds a black card, "Nemesis" and "Republic of Korea" imprinted on its surface, her expression veiled in mystery.
6.0.D.jpg;  A hand, bathed in yellow light, reaches out, fingers spread wide, the word "seriously..." echoing above it.
6.0.E.1.jpg;  The floor stretches out, a light yellow expanse, the words "it drives people crazy" hanging in the air.
6.1.A.jpg;  He sits in the office chair, clad in a black leather jacket, lost in contemplation. 
6.1.B.jpg;  The young woman, her purple hair a striking contrast to the green jacket, holds the card, a playful glint in her eyes.
6.1.C.0.jpg;  A hand emerges, holding a black card, the word "hold on" appearing in a white box below it. 
6.1.C.1.jpg;  He looks up in surprise, his glasses reflecting the shock on his face, the words "is geon ji-o your cousin who's repeating this year in college?" a blur in his vision.  
6.1.D.jpg;  Sasejong, the Babylon vice guild leader, stands in the room, holding a white object, his face a picture of worry. "Speak well about her or you'll die." the words echo in his mind,  
6.1.E.jpg;  The man sits at the table, hands covering his face, his shame palpable. "There's a lot to be ashamed of. What's wrong with repeating it." the words taunt him. 
6.1.F.jpg;  One eye pierces through the darkness, a hand muffles his mouth, "three times?" he asks, a steely determination in his gaze. "It's not just Geon Ji-o's fault."
6.2.A.jpg;  The three sit around the table, the tension thick in the air. "The university is a bit strange." the man standing remarks, "it's not that the kid doesn't have a good head, it's just that she doesn't study." "Could there be something wrong with academic corruption?" the man sitting wonders, suspicion creeping into his voice.
6.2.B.jpg;  "No soulless talk." the man sitting thinks, his eyes fixed on the man standing, who appears surprised.
6.2.C.jpg;  He runs a hand over his forehead, his expression troubled, "From your point of view, we're a separated family, right? Don't you wonder how someone doesn't tell his family about his well-being?"
6.2.D.jpg;  "Oh, yes." the man in the black suit begins, holding the white paper, "but why would your cousin..." "Smooth transition of topic by the Babylon." the words appear above him. 
6.2.E.0.jpg;  His mouth hangs open, anger flashing in his eyes, "That troublemaker." the words below him reveal.
6.2.E.1.jpg;  His middle finger rises, defiance in his gaze, a single word escapes his lips, "What?"
6.3.A.0.jpg;  The man's head and shoulders appear, his eyes downcast, the words "She ran away from home!!" echoing in the air, his sadness palpable.  
6.3.A.1.jpg;  His mouth hangs open, eyes wide with panic, a fist clenched, "Ho!" he cries, his fear echoing in the dark room. 
6.3.B.0.jpg;  He paces, glasses reflecting his worry, "Isn't she an adult? She can be independent, right?" he asks, a desperate edge to his voice.  "Can't you grasp the seriousness of the situation?!" he shouts,  "She went out empty-handed, without even a credit card!" 
6.3.B.1.jpg;  He sits at the table, his eyes wide with worry, "Dragging a bamboo pole through this freezing world!" he whispers, despair lacing his words.
6.3.C.0.jpg;  The man in the black suit stands, papers clutched in his hand, his face a mask of concern. "You guys..." he pleads. "Help me please. Help me." the words echoing in the formal office setting. 
6.3.C.1.jpg;  He sits in the chair, hands covering his face, his shoulders slumped,  "You're all psychopaths!" he cries. 
6.4.A.jpg;  He stands, a sly smirk playing on his lips, a hint of amusement in his eyes, "Ah..." he says, the word trailing off. 
6.4.B.jpg;  The paper lays open, the words stark against the white backdrop,  "Official letter proposing cooperation between the 5 major guilds in relation to the 39th floor of the tower of babel"  "Guild Babylon - Proposal for strengthening tutorial-related forces recruitment of adventurers."
6.4.C.jpg;  The compass sits in the center of the light blue canvas, "Ranker's Guide" inscribed above it, "To have a 20-year-old boss..." the words at the top of the page hint at a tale of mystery and intrigue. 
6.4.D.jpg;  The words "Ordinary Life" hang in the air, a peaceful and tranquil scene stretching out below, a gray-sided building with windows and an air conditioner, a picture of quiet normalcy.
6.5.A.0.jpg;  Her eyes widen in shock, a startled expression on her face, "...What?" the word hangs in the air, echoing her disbelief. 
6.5.A.1.jpg;  The woman, her "God is My Passport" hoodie a stark contrast to the fear in her eyes, stares in shock, a spoon clutched in her hand. "God is my passport." she whispers.
6.5.B.jpg;  The woman stands, her white hoodie a beacon of worry, "Are you leaving home? For a week?"  The man, washing dishes in the kitchen, looks over with a neutral expression, "Yes." he replies. 
6.5.C.jpg;  She stands, her mouth agape, "You have to cook and eat alone." she says. The man's voice echoes from behind her, "Then who will cook for me?"
6.5.D.0.jpg;  The woman, glasses perched on her nose, looks at the man with a mixture of shock and annoyance, "Then who's going to buy groceries for me?" she asks. "Go and buy it yourself." he replies.
6.5.D.1.jpg;  The man scrubs dishes, pink gloves protecting his hands, "What about the laundry and cleaning?" he asks.  She stands beside him, her "God is My Passport" hoodie blending into the background. 
6.5.E.0.jpg;  He looks straight ahead, his face a picture of worry, "What about in-game cash purchases?" he asks. "What about the errands?" she replies. 
6.5.E.1.jpg;  The sink gleams, a white plate resting inside, "Who's going to catch bugs if they come out?" the words hang in the air, thick with anger and annoyance.
6.5.F.jpg;  He stands, his expression a mixture of annoyance and shock, "That's because you just eat snacks while lying down all day!" he exclaims. "If you just didn't do that, there wouldn't be any need to do laundry or for bugs to come out to eat your leftover crumbs!"
6.6.A.jpg;  He looks to the right, his face contorted in annoyance, "And if you keep lying down and eating like that." he warns, "you'll get reflux esophagitis and even diabetes!"
6.6.B.0.jpg;  She stands before him, her "God is My Passport" hoodie a symbol of her anger, "What is that!" she explodes. "So you're saying you're going to throw me away without even paying for my medical bills?" 
6.6.B.1.jpg;  The man stands in the kitchen, his black shirt a stark contrast to the small child's pink gloves, his eyes looking down at the child who tugs at his arm. "I didn't say that?!" he exclaims, a hint of panic in his voice.
6.6.C.jpg;  The girl, her white hoodie emblazoned with "God is My Passport." throws a plate, anger fueling her every movement. "I don't care! I hate you!" she screams, her words echoing the intensity of her emotions.
6.6.D.0.jpg;  He stands above her, his anger palpable, "Is that your answer when you say it so cutely?! That's gaslighting! Sit down here!" he demands. 
6.6.D.1.jpg;  He looks at her, his pink-gloved hands a stark contrast to her white hoodie, "I don't want to know." she whispers, her eyes fixed on something beyond him. 
6.6.E.jpg;  Her face is a mask of anger, her red lips drawn into a tight line, "You can't even season soybean paste stew properly!" she yells.
6.6.F.jpg;  Her mouth is open, her scream echoing the intensity of her rage. 
6.6.G.jpg;  The boy runs, his long, thin shadow stretching behind him, his sadness mirrored in the girl's wide, still shadow. 
6.7.A.jpg;  She stands, her "God Everybody Down!" hoodie a stark contrast to the fear in her eyes, her hands covering her mouth. "Why Didn't Anyone Hear a Gun?" the words on her sweatshirt seem to echo her shock and surprise. 
6.7.B.jpg;  Two pink-gloved hands, water dripping from them, a stark reminder of fear and anxiety.
6.7.C.0.jpg;  The water drop, a bright white splash against the dark water, a moment of peace and tranquility.  
6.7.C.1.jpg;  He nervously glances down, fiddling with his dark top. " ...you said it was delicious." 
6.7.D.0.jpg;  "it was a 100 x 1 recipe.."  The man with blue hair and a pink glove looks troubled.  "with beef brisket.."  The man in the white shirt looks terrified.
6.7.D.1.jpg;  Grinning widely, she clenches her fist.  "the trait 'iron face' has been partially disabled!"  Her eyes sparkle with excitement.  "i-i take it back. the soybean paste stew was really delicious."
6.8.A.jpg;  "...is that so?" The man in the black shirt looks uncomfortable.  "it was a bit sweet, but it was fine."  His eyes dart around nervously as the woman in the grey sweatshirt watches him closely.
6.8.B.0.jpg;  Giving a thumbs up, she beams.  "just do better next time! cheer up!"  "yes. i will work hard and get better at cooking."
6.8.B.1.jpg;  She touches her temple, her face filled with surprise.  "the trait 'iron face' has evolved to the next level."  "second job conditions completed - do you want to change jobs to 'professional fraudster'?"  "anyway, where are you going for a week?"
6.8.C.jpg;  The dirty pink gloves hang on the hook.  "ah, that's..."  She seems embarrassed.
6.8.D.0.jpg;  He smiles with determination, his eyes fixed on the ground. "because of this."  
6.8.D.1.jpg;  He looks troubled, clutching his arms to his chest.  "l sh 0000"  is visible on his arm.  "invitation to the tower of babel. as soon as it is opened, the shape of a barbell is imprinted on the body of the prospective" 
6.8.E.jpg;  The yellow box explains the workings of the tutorial system.  "awakener. the time remaining until the tutorial opens is displayed. it is generally 'gold' and has different colors depending on the purpose." 
6.9.A.jpg;  "if it's gold' then it's not even transferred"  The woman furrows her brow.  "didn't you have a covenant before? then why again..."  She ponders the question.
6.9.B.0.jpg;  The man in the dark t-shirt clenches his fist, looking concerned.  The woman with short blue hair in the background has a surprised expression.  
6.9.B.1.jpg;  "It is currently sealed."  The man and woman stand on the rug, both looking confused.  
6.9.C.0.jpg;  The glowing gold chest sits in the center of the image, surrounded by a dark purple background with twinkling stars.  "i promised to acknowledge him again as he was before regression."
6.9.C.1.jpg;  "with my star."  The image feels magical and ethereal, filled with light white and yellow stars against a dark purple backdrop.
6.9.D.0.jpg;  Her eyes are filled with anger. "what do you believe in? stars are all crooks."  A thick chain lies in the bottom of the image. 
6.9.D.1.jpg;  The thick chain covers the wooden chest.  "he may never choose you again."  The image feels powerful and dangerous. 
6.10.A.jpg;  The man's eyes are closed. "luascans.com"  He looks weary and thoughtful.
6.10.B.0.jpg;  "it's not about trusting the divine being."  The man looks hopeful. 
6.10.B.1.jpg;  "it's about trusting myself to walk the same path no matter what happens."  He clenches his fist, looking determined. 
6.10.C.0.jpg;  "since i've regressed."  the hand reaches for the bright star in the sky.  "i broke up with the holy widow." 
6.10.C.1.jpg;  The man with blue hair smiles.  "there's no reason for my beliefs to change."  "since it's gone." 
6.11.A.0.jpg;  "what's up with this coolness...?" The woman's eyes widen in excitement.  "at this rate, i'll just..."
6.11.A.1.jpg;  "he will end up as a supporting role for the main protagonist...!!"  The man smiles confidently.  "i see a halo around him!"
6.11.B.0.jpg;  "your covenant, the 'reader of fate', is irritated by telling you to take it in moderation before your brother gets really angry."  The man in the hooded robe looks worried.
6.11.B.1.jpg;  "what halo you're talking about? there's none. i'll scold you harshly to open your eyes properly."  The character is surprised.
6.11.C.jpg;  "oh, there's nothing?"  She scratches her head, looking confused.
6.11.D.0.jpg;  "...nothing."  The man smiles calmly.
6.11.D.1.jpg;  "...then what's with this coolness?"  He tilts his head in confusion.
6.12.A.jpg;  "hmm...well...anyway...."  The woman coughs, her eyes closed. 
6.12.B.jpg;  "are you already going to sleep?"  He looks concerned, watching the figure curled up in the bed.
6.12.C.jpg;  "it's too hot under this blanket.."  She looks worried, her purple eyes wide open.
6.12.D.jpg;  "then rest well. i'll turn off the lights."  The man looks calm and peaceful as he watches the figure in bed.
6.12.E.0.jpg;  The woman's dark hair shimmers with blue sparkles. 
6.12.E.1.jpg;  Her eyes are wide open, filled with worry.  Blue sparkles dance around her.
6.13.A.0.jpg;  "shut up, you disposable poop star."  She sleeps soundly, seemingly oblivious to the insults.
6.13.A.1.jpg;  "poop star? what's this again"  The woman reaches for the air, her face filled with amusement.  "is it a fancy nickname?"  "they were mocking baek do-hyun. earlier."  "were you not excited to ask who he was when he regressed?!"
6.13.B.jpg;  "forget it. i don't care about either. get lost!"  She sleeps soundly, seemingly annoyed.
6.13.C.0.jpg;  The night sky shines through the open window.
6.13.C.1.jpg;  The white curtains flutter in the wind, revealing the starry night sky. 
6.14.A.0.jpg;  "i like it best when you're sulking like this but still leaving room for negotiation."  The man lies on the floor, his face a mix of pain, sadness, and fear.
6.14.A.1.jpg;  "regression, huh."  The woman sleeps peacefully, her face serene.
7.0.A.0.jpg;  "to support us!"  The two women smile brightly, microphones in hand. "hello, viewers!" "mona"  "lisa" 
7.0.A.1.jpg;  "i'm mona, the mc of good morning babel. always bringing you the latest news of the ranker world."  "and i'm mc lisa!"
7.0.B.0.jpg;  "last night. the dawn guild led by ranker hwang-hoon."  The man looks shocked and surprised.
7.0.B.1.jpg;  "gifted korea the sound of victory!"  The man stands tall in the snowy field, determined and intense.
7.1.A.jpg;  "after a long 5 months, the 39th floor has been unlocked, so everyone's expectations are high!"  She smiles, looking enthusiastic.  "since it's the "nine segments of the demon." each guild will likely mobilise elite members for a joint attack, right?"
7.1.B.0.jpg;  "that's right! it's a national event that produces new rankers twice a year!"  "lisa" "it's just before "tutorial week.""  "during "tutorial week" - all floors except the tutorial field will be closed, giving each guild time to regroup."  "and the public's attention will be focused on "tutorial week"!"  "especially during the opening of the "nine segments of the demon.""
7.1.B.1.jpg;  "there's a rumour that tutorial participants have a high chance of being chosen by the higher seats!"  The man looks serious, standing before the city.  "in the year when the 29th floor was opened, two super rookies, geon ji-rok and hwang-hoon, appeared!"  "can we expect the birth of new s-class rankers?"  "first, let's watch the caught! hot minute video!"
7.2.A.0.jpg;  "this is a tip-off video sent by "please let koreans pop!".  The feeling is confusing, tense, and mysterious. 
7.2.A.1.jpg;  The man knelt down, his arms wrapped around the woman. 
7.2.B.0.jpg;  His face was dirty, a small red mark below his right eye, but his eyes were wide and intense as he stared directly at the viewer, "hero of seolleung station!".
7.2.B.1.jpg;  He wore a blue shirt and jacket, his gaze fixed on the ground, a small red mark beneath his right eye still visible.
7.2.C.0.jpg;  A shocked voice announced, "Oh, it seems like Baek is doing well on screen.",  the man's face, with its small red mark, shown on a screen held in a black clamp.
7.2.C.1.jpg;  She relaxed in bed, holding a small snack in one hand and a cup of tea in the other. 
7.2.D.jpg;  His face, marked with a small red bruise, stared from the phone screen.  "?", the caption asked.
7.3.A.jpg;  Lying on the bed, phone in one hand and cup in the other, she glared at the screen, "What are you looking at? Are you trying to catch me?"   "At best, it's just with Jaji and Hwang-hoon's rankings...", she muttered angrily. 
7.3.B.0.jpg;  "1 a1", it read, followed by "......?", her blue eyes with pink sparkles wide in surprise.
7.3.B.1.jpg;  "Hey, what's up? I knew you'd be like this someday. lol", a message accompanied by a deer emoji. "Currently, Geon Ji-o's domestic rank is 2nd 1.", the caption stated, the futuristic scene bathed in bright purple and blue lights. 
7.3.C.jpg;  Her eyes were wide, large red circles surrounding them, as she stammered, "Why are you swearing? You're not thinking bad thoughts, are you?". "?????????????????",  the caption echoed her confusion. 
7.4.A.0.jpg;  A bright blue screen, tilted at a 45-degree angle, flashed with text, "klol0l". "What's this? What's going on?", the text box below it questioned.  "Hey, answer the phone. If you don't, I'll issue a wanted order for you.", a deer head staring menacingly below. 
7.4.A.1.jpg;  Floating upside down, surrounded by stars, the man in his white shirt and black pants cried out in despair, "Give me back my first place--!!".
7.4.C.jpg;  The muscular man, wrapped in a white towel, stood awkwardly in the bathroom,  "Excuse me, sir. Do you have any separate visitors scheduled for today?"
7.4.D.jpg;  A cigarette rested between his lips, his face relaxed, "It's almost time for the tutorial to start."
7.5.A.jpg;  "What's going on?", he asked, towel wrapped around him, his tattooed back facing the viewer. 
7.5.B.jpg;  Two men in blue shirts and black caps stood, one holding a walkie-talkie, concern etched on their faces. "Well... it's not like that, but in the lobby of the residence..." "It's awkward if you do it here!", one of them said. 
7.5.C.0.jpg;  "It's not something that can be forced!", she argued, arms crossed, her purple eyes flashing with frustration.
7.5.C.1.jpg;  Sitting on the tiled floor, arms crossed, he appeared calm and confident. 
7.5.D.jpg;  The two men in blue uniforms and black caps stood, one holding a walkie-talkie, while the woman in a black hoodie sat on the ground, arms and legs crossed.  "Due to security reasons, only residents and those with reservations can enter!", one of the men announced. "If you keep doing this, we can't help it either!", the other warned.  
7.5.E.jpg;  The man in the blue uniform and black cap stood, foot planted on the ground, questioning the woman, "Hey, are you a Ranker?" "I'm just an ordinary person. If you touch me, the bracelet will rattle." she replied. "This is the lobby where people come and go. Stop it now-", he warned, the tension in the air palpable. 
7.6.A.jpg;  She stood, her dark jacket pulled tight, apprehension etched on her face.
7.6.B.0.jpg;  "Vice President!", the text above his head, the man in grey pants and a white t-shirt, held the woman's black hoodie, his gaze fixed on her worried face.
7.6.B.1.jpg;  "Unknown age ranked 7th in South Korea, Mr. Beom", read the text below, as the two men, one in black sandals, the other in black and white striped sandals, walked casually towards the right.
7.6.C.jpg;  "Return to your posts.", the man's stern gaze, silver hair shining,  "I'll handle this.", he declared.
7.6.D.jpg;  "You're used to pointing fingers at people.", she teased, her black hoodie pulled tight,  "Yes, sir!", she replied confidently.
7.6.E.jpg;  "Excuse me!", she said, bowing respectfully as she entered the building, the three men in black and white uniforms bowing in response. 
7.7.A.jpg;  "That's right.", the text above her head, a mischievous glint in her eye, she looked at the viewer, intrigued and amused.
7.7.B.jpg;  "Ji-o?", the man with short grey hair asked, holding the woman's black hoodie, a playful glint in his eye,  her gaze fixed on something to the right, her discomfort evident. 
7.7.C.jpg;  "Loading", the caption read, as the grey cat with black stripes, holding a black cat in its mouth, walked towards the right, leaving paw prints in its wake.
7.7.D.0.jpg;  "I gave you the keycard. Why are you causing a commotion downstairs?", the text below the tall, luxurious building. 
7.7.D.1.jpg;  "I lost it.", the text above his head, the man with grey hair held the woman close, her black hoodie pulled tight, her face sad as she looked up at him,  "I'll install the app on your phone, so take good care of it.", the text below them.
7.8.A.0.jpg;  "And that...", the text above her head, the woman sat on the couch, black hoodie pulled tight, her hand resting on the seat, "Isn't that an outfit you haven't worn before?", the text below, a hint of shock on her face. 
7.8.A.1.jpg;  "Really? Isn't it something I've always had?", she asked, her expression confused,  "It's been a while since you've seen it, so you pretended not to recognize it."
7.8.B.0.jpg;  "Yeah", the text above his head, the man smiled, his white shirt crisp,  "It was hard to see your face, Ms. Geon Ji-o.", the text below.
7.8.B.1.jpg;  "You showed up wearing men's clothes that didn't fit you at all after almost three months, insisting they were yours...", the text below her, her black hoodie with a design,  her face a picture of sadness. 
7.8.C.jpg;  "Oh, they're Geon Ji-rok's", the text above her, her purple eyes wide, her mouth open in shock. 
7.9.A.0.jpg;  "The smell of night rain, I know it well.", the text above her head, a hand from the right reached out to touch hers,  "Excuse me.",  the text to the right, her purple eyes meeting his, confusion evident on her face.  "Oh, anyway!", the text below the man, his white shirt visible. 
7.9.A.1.jpg;  "I have something to discuss. Are you busy?", the text below the woman, her thoughtful expression as she sat on the couch,  the man, in a white shirt and black pants, walking towards her. 
7.9.B.jpg;  "It's already eleven o'clock. We should start getting ready soon.", the text above his head, the man in a white shirt, pulling his shirt up, his gaze fixed on something to the right.
7.9.C.jpg;  "Ready? What's happening today...", the text above her head, a rectangular device in her hand,  "Oh", the text to the left, her purple eyes wide,  looking towards the right. 
7.9.D.0.jpg;  "I'll be back soon.", the text above his head,  the young man smiled, his blue bag slung over his shoulder, "That's right. The tutorial.", the text below him,  as he stood in front of the digital clock, 00:01:11:49,  "Tutorial D-day opening soon...", the text above.
7.9.D.1.jpg;  "Are you explaining as you go?", the text below him, the hooded man with a bare chest smiled,  "What is Tutorial Week? It's an event that produces new Rankers twice a year!", the text above him.  "During this period, entry into the tower outside of the tutorial field is restricted!",  the text below the screen. 
7.9.E.jpg;  "If this happens, 'that guy' and 'that guy' will be together...", the text above her head, the young woman with short purple hair, her hand on her chin, stared into the distance,  worried. 
7.10.A.0.jpg;  "It's obvious what your business is.", the top text declared,  "'Give me back my first place!'",  the bottom text, bold and insistent. 
7.10.A.1.jpg;  Her head peeked from behind the wall, her short black hair framing her surprised face, her eyes wide with shock as she looked up at the man. 
7.10.B.0.jpg;  The man stood shirtless, his back adorned with a large tattoo of circles and symbols,  his grey hair catching the light, his gaze fixed on something to the right, an air of mystery surrounding him. 
7.10.B.1.jpg;  "Right?", the top text read, the man with the large tattoo on his back, wearing a grey t-shirt, stood confidently. "Let's just change clothes and go to the tower together.", the bottom text proclaimed. 
7.10.C.jpg;  "...", the top text, the woman with short black hair smiled, her gaze fixed on something to the right,  "And you've lost weight again. Eat well.", the bottom text, as the shirtless man stood, arms crossed,  shyly looking to the left.
7.10.D.0.jpg;  "...As expected, you're cool.", the text below her,  she lay on her back, her black hoodie with a graphic design pulled tight, her eyes wide in surprise,  "Luascans.com",  the text below.
7.10.D.1.jpg;  "Your Covenant, the one who reads destiny, has caught you taking a dirty glance.", the blue digital screen displayed. "Why is there nudity in a comedy? People will raise ethical concerns, saying it's not appropriate for the age rating.", the text below, as the hooded man in a white robe, holding a sign with an image of a hand stopping a male and female symbol, looked annoyed. "Luascans.com", the text below him. 
7.11.A.jpg;  She lay on the bed,  eyes wide and confused, whispering to herself, "... if I had just aged another 10 years." 
7.11.B.0.jpg;  She stood on the street, clutching the bouquet of purple flowers, her face etched with sadness. 
7.11.B.1.jpg; The tall man in the black suit walked away, his hands deep in his pockets, looking indifferent to the world around him. 
7.11.C.jpg; She stood there, bouquet of flowers in hand, her expression a mixture of sadness and disappointment, whispering, "... I probably wouldn't have been caught back then."
7.11.D.0.jpg; The cloaked figure stood still, their head lowered, only their mouth visible, pondering the words above them, "even though he's an unlucky guy, the one who reads destiny nods his head vigorously, saying that conscience and common sense are firmly ingrained in him."
7.11.D.1.jpg;  She glared, annoyed and upset, "star, are you going to keep breaking your promise?" 
7.12.A.0.jpg;  The man in the glasses smiled confidently, looking assured as he walked away, saying, "geon ji-o, everything is ready. Let's go."  The guild silver lion was visible in the background.
7.12.A.1.jpg;  The blue lion roared, its power and menace obvious.  A man in a dark jacket stood in the center of the image, looking up at the lion, surrounded by other men in suits. They stood resolute and determined. The lion's strength was clear.  "The largest scale, the strongest force... and the longest history. Their leader, 'Lion' Eun Seokwon, firmly maintained the top spot in Korea until Ji-o's debut." 
7.12.B.jpg;  He stood there, head bowed, looking thoughtful and concerned.
7.13.A.0.jpg;  The young woman looked down, her face a picture of sadness and defeat, as she read the words above her, "the hero of Korea, who always fought disasters at the forefront -  please be kind and give up the first place." 
7.13.A.1.jpg;  She stood in the hallway, her hand on her cheek, anger evident in her eyes as she shouted, "It's wrong to steal the rankings of poor third-year students!"
7.13.B.0.jpg; The black car turned right at the intersection, the driver seeming indifferent to the world around them, muttering, "You're still correcting it. Your laziness doesn't even cross my mind." 
7.13.B.1.jpg; The two sat in the car, one in a black hoodie, the other in a black suit, talking in hushed tones.  "Hmph." the man in the suit said.  "He must have a backbone disease or something. Oh, Geon Ji-o." 
7.13.C.jpg;  The textbox held information about the man,  "Except for being picked up by Eun Seokwon in his childhood while wandering the streets, there is no information about him. Judging roughly from appearance, he's probably around his thirties." 
7.13.D.jpg; She stood there, hand on her chin, a look of disgust and annoyance on her face,  "Hmph. Go about." 
7.13.E.jpg;  The textbox described the man's incredible strength, "Powerful seal symbols engraved directly on his back by the 'Great Witch of the Polar Regions', serving as evidence of his strength."
7.14.A.0.jpg;  The intricate tattoos on his back, ancient and filled with text, whispered of a hidden past.
7.14.A.1.jpg;  The textbox explained the man's abilities, "It's a well-known fact in the heavenly realm that he is a skilled individual who has several hidden moves."
7.14.B.0.jpg;  He stood alone in the empty room,  his sadness evident,  as he read the words above him, "Eun Seokwon was designated as the guardian of the leader of 'Silver Lion,' and received fame and recognition as his right-hand man."
7.14.B.1.jpg;  The young boy looked up at the man in the black suit with admiration.  "Ten years ago, he was selected as the guardian of the first S-class ranker, Ji-o." 
7.14.C.0.jpg;  He spoke in a hushed tone, "He's among the very few people who know my identity. That's why it's so hard to handle."
7.14.C.1.jpg;  She looked to the right, her black collar a stark contrast against her pale skin, saying, "It's temporary." 
7.14.D.0.jpg;  The man in the black suit smiled, "He said he broke through the last barrier."  The second man, also in a black suit, left the room, leaving the first man alone.
7.14.D.1.jpg; He walked away,  closing the door behind him,  "As he emerged from the closed tower early this morning." 
7.15.A.0.jpg; The man in the car looked straight ahead. "Please respect the lion's last roar before dawn. As for who occupies the 'pinnacle' position." 
7.15.A.1.jpg; She sat in the car, her gaze focused on the road ahead, her expression wary,  "Everyone knows."
7.15.B.jpg;  He smiled, his eyes sparkling with warmth,  "Your Majesty."
7.15.C.jpg;  The woman stood beside the man. "Hey, don't console me. I'm just unlucky."  He chuckled, "He actually seems to like it. His tastes are peculiar."
7.15.D.0.jpg;  The city bustled with life, the sun shining brightly as the traffic light turned green. "When Grandpa retires and his head changes, I'll start by crushing the Silver Lion building." The words seemed to dance in the air, carrying an undercurrent of excitement and anticipation.  "That's kind of cute."
7.15.D.1.jpg;   She pointed at the poster behind her, her anger bubbling over, "I will catch that tiger bastard outside, but..."  The poster depicted a man, his face contorted in anger, and the words "Yes, you were fooled, right?" were written next to it. "They criticize me for not shaving and scratching my stomach at home."
7.15.E.jpg;  He smiled, his thumb on his lip, looking amused as he said to someone off-panel, "That's really scary." 
7.16.A.0.jpg; The blue sky was dotted with white clouds, moving slowly and gently in a light breeze.  "Ah, are you going to tease me until the end?" 
7.16.A.1.jpg;  The tall grey stone tower loomed in the background, its many levels reaching towards the bright blue sky. The top 20 rankers list was visible on its side, and the wheel of a vehicle could be seen in the foreground. 
7.16.B.jpg; She stood in the city, her hands clasped to her face, her eyes wide with surprise. "I'm leaving first. Bye." The man in the dark suit stood beside her, looking at her with a knowing expression.
7.16.C.0.jpg;  He smiled, his dark eyes twinkling with amusement as he looked up at the blue sky,  "... how can you lie about something so cutely."
7.16.C.1.jpg;  He smiled, holding his phone in his right hand,  "Anyway, you're still young." 
8.0.A.0.jpg;  She stood in the city, her phone in hand, a bright smile on her face.  "To support us!" The words were visible above her head, along with "I've checked your ticket, your name is..." and "I'm just a supporting character. I'm Joyeon!"
8.0.A.1.jpg;  She sat on the wooden floor, legs crossed, a determined look on her face.  "My mother told me..."  The man beside her,  also sitting with his legs crossed,  asked,  "Joyeon, have you ever heard of *The Witch Queen* who always stays at the top?"  She nodded,  her eyes shining with determination.  "Yes, mother! How could I not know about her! I'm also going to keep this old adage in mind and never give up on my dream of becoming a ranker..."  He shook his head,  "Not this time."
8.0.B.jpg;  He stood there, pointing his finger at the woman, his face filled with anger.  "Why would your name be Joyeon?" The woman, her back turned to the viewer, replied,  "The Queen's name is very similar to you, but you definitely have different characteristics."
8.1.A.jpg;  She sat on the floor,  her legs crossed,  her face a mix of surprise and confusion.   "However!  This is something you must also know. Happiness ultimately belongs to the supporting characters."   "Ah... what?" 
8.1.B.0.jpg;  The dragon's head roared, its power evident, "In the world, those who are the main characters are either the best or the worst. Their lives are full of ups and downs and noisy days." 
8.1.B.1.jpg;  She stood before the pyramid,  a small mummy floating above her,  her brow furrowed in confusion. "But in the middle of the pyramid? No one pays attention. It's peaceful and comfortable."
8.1.C.0.jpg; He pointed, his eyes wide with excitement and astonishment, "The supporting character is the winner!"
8.1.C.1.jpg;  The image faded from dark gray to white,  a somber moment in time,  "Always remember this, my daughter!"
8.1.D.0.jpg;  She smiled, a look of confidence in her eyes,  "Please watch over me, Mother! From today, this daughter will walk confidently as the supporting character!"
8.1.D.1.jpg;  The man walked towards the tall tower in the distance, his steps determined. "Top 10 Rankings" was visible above the tower.
8.2.A.0.jpg; The Top 10 Rankings were displayed in a metal frame, each entry indicating a change in position.  "1 Eun Seok-won."  "2 Choi/Private."  "3 Alpha Jeong Gil."  "4 White Bird Gaon."  "Rock Bambi." "5 Persistence." "6 Twilight." "7 Tiger."  "8 Top Leader Kim Si-Gyun."  "10 Hong."
8.2.A.1.jpg; The large black tower stood in the distance, a sign announcing the Top 10 Rankings.  "10 Honggoya"  was visible above the tower, the rankings below it.
8.2.B.0.jpg; She stood there, her hands clasped together, a look of worry etched on her face.  "Hwa, your Majesty... When the rankings were updated this morning, the whole country was in an uproar."
8.2.B.1.jpg; The man stared at his phone, his face a picture of shock.  "Huh?" The woman behind him,  looking at her phone, also uttered, "Huh?"  The city around them buzzed with life.  
8.2.C.0.jpg;  "What!?"  The earth looms in the distance, a blurry sphere hanging in the void.  
8.2.C.1.jpg;  "Of course, if it's her majesty, I believe she'll regain the top spot!" The earth remains a distant blur, yet a sense of confidence fills the air.
8.2.D.0.jpg;  "I must become the supporting character."  The words echo in a white and orange expanse.  "I must become the best supporting character and beat up those who trouble her majesty."  A determined glint appears in the woman's eyes. 
8.2.D.1.jpg;  "That's why you should be careful with your nickname." Her fist clenches, anger radiating from her.
8.3.A.0.jpg;  "Who would have thought that once you decide, you can't change it?"  A gray backdrop surrounds her, reflecting the confusion in her voice.  "'Late night king', 'renewing tomorrow's public certificate', stuff like that. Isn't that right?"
8.3.A.1.jpg;  "Have you decided on your nickname?"  Two women stand amidst the gray, their conversation seemingly ordinary.
8.3.B.jpg;  "Ah, I'm going with 'the supporting character'... No, just a supporting character."  A pink and white background surrounds them as the woman laughs.  "That's cute. I'm Lomi." 
8.3.C.0.jpg;  "There were really a lot of people participating in the tutorial today."  The woman in the grey hoodie nods.  "They're social butterflies. I exchanged greetings with people from the subway station."  The white and blue background reflects the calmness of the scene.
8.3.C.1.jpg;  A dark blue background surrounds a bright, glowing blue circle.  The structure shimmers, each ring pulsating with unseen energy.  
8.3.D.0.jpg;  The night sky stretches above a glass ceiling shaped like a flower.  The stars shine brightly, filling the enclosed space with a sense of wonder. 
8.3.D.1.jpg;  "So this is the ground floor." The woman walks confidently toward the center of the room, her gaze determined.  
8.4.A.0.jpg;   The man stares at his phone, a look of surprise and worry crossing his face. "There's so many people..!" The woman next to him echoes his concern.
8.4.A.1.jpg;   "Don't be nervous, Joyeon! Anyway, everyone here is a supporting character candidate..." The woman's fist clenches, her annoyance evident.
8.4.B.jpg;   "The main characters are probably watching us from the rumored 'monitor room'."  Balconies line the left side of the room, while the words hang heavy in the air.
8.4.C.0.jpg;   "There's no reason for me to lose in this supporting character battle!"  The woman with long brown hair stands tall, her determination unwavering. "Sis! Supporting character sis!"  
8.4.C.1.jpg;  "Nice to meet you. This is someone I met on the subway earlier, and they seem really nice."  The man smiles warmly, his words filled with enthusiasm. "Since he is a re-entry, maybe he'll even get first place? Just kidding haha."
8.4.D.jpg;   "Uhm, Ms. Lomi... your words..." The man blushes, his hand covering his mouth. "Are you embarrassed? You're too cute. Well then, you should greet each other."
8.4.E.jpg;   "Oh, yes."  The woman stands stoic, her gaze unwavering. The anticipation in the air is palpable. 
8.5.A.jpg;   A hand extends, palm open and welcoming.  
8.5.B.0.jpg;   "Nice to meet you."  The man smiles, a warm welcome in his eyes. 
8.5.B.1.jpg;  "My name is Baek Do-hyun."  The man smiles, extending his hand in greeting. 
8.5.C.0.jpg;   "Ah... this..."  The woman's eyes widen, a mix of surprise and worry in her expression. 
8.5.C.1.jpg;   "Person..."  The black background emphasizes the white text, highlighting the mystery surrounding the new character. "He might not be a supporting character..." 
8.6.A.jpg;   "The Ranker's Guide to Live an Ordinary Life."  The title card sparkles with whimsical charm, hinting at a story filled with magic and ordinary life.
8.6.B.jpg;   "Inside the 'monitor room' of the Babel tower."  The view from above shows a bustling scene, with people casually sitting on the ledges of the tower.  "Room accessible up to Rank 100."  The words appear below, adding a sense of mystery to the setting.  "No way."
8.6.C.0.jpg;  "There's a heavenly-class cluster down there." The woman with purple hair stares in disbelief. "Why did you come to the senior center?"
8.6.C.1.jpg;  "Stop using strange words, David."  The woman with black hair stands firm, her expression serious.  "White bird, ranked 4th in the national ranking."  The words appear beneath her, adding to the intensity of the scene. "Choi David, registered name: David, ranked 8th in the national ranking."
8.6.D.jpg;  "Hey, why did you bring me here when I am busy with my scouts?"  The man with purple hair leans back, a hint of annoyance in his voice. "..."
8.6.E.jpg;  "Were you busy?" The woman with black hair glares, her anger evident. "This is my first time hearing this." "Hey! You big-headed fool!" 
8.6.F.jpg;   "It's the official vacation period given by Babel." The man with purple hair speaks, his tone casual. "Of course, you should have fun and enjoy dynamic activities!"  The other two people listen intently. "Those two girls of Huita..."  The man's eyes dart to the side. "Let's not look at them, we'll just sit still and be quiet."  
8.7.A.0.jpg; "This session is special, that's why I brought you along." The woman's eyes are closed, a weariness settling over her face. 
8.7.A.1.jpg;  "Special? What's so special about it?"  The woman with the vibrant purple and orange hair leans forward, excitement in her eyes.  "The 19th, 29th, and 39th floors have opened. There's a high chance it'll become the third golden generation."
8.7.B.0.jpg;   "You..."  The woman with the vibrant hair looks surprised. "'The 29th floor is probably referring to 'Bambi' and the 'midnight snack maniac', and the 19th floor is..."  Her eyes widen. "Who might that be?"
8.7.B.1.jpg;  "It seems like you keep forgetting, but you're also a valuable S-class, David."  The woman blushes, embarrassed by the reminder.
8.7.C.jpg;  "W-well, why didn't you say that from the beginning, then?"  The woman's annoyance is evident in her voice. "Whatever. So are all our channel members coming?"
8.7.D.jpg; "I'm not sure, but they said Eun Seokwon is definitely coming."  The woman looks thoughtful, pondering the implications. "That..."
8.7.E.jpg; "...They say even a lion comes when you call them."  The woman's voice trails off, her expression contemplative. 
8.8.A.0.jpg;  The three men stand tall, their faces serious and determined.  "Monitor room | 1st place Eun Seokwon's entry. Monitor room | 16th place: Ahn Chisan's entry."  The words above them reflect the importance of their task.  
8.8.A.1.jpg;  The men continue to stand, their focus unwavering.  The blue light emanating from the last man's shoes adds a sense of urgency to the scene. 
8.8.B.jpg;  A group of four stands in a circle, their expressions serious and focused. The weight of the situation is palpable. 
8.8.C.jpg;  "If the other hunters get to it first, our profits would dwindle."  The man with the eyepatch leans back in his chair, worry etched on his face.  
8.8.D.jpg;   The two men stand in the doorway, anticipation radiating from them. "Luascans.com"
8.9.A.0.jpg;  "Monitor room | 5th place: Geon Ji-rok's position."  One man looks sad, while the other is filled with anger.  "Young master, are you still upset?"
8.9.A.1.jpg;  "No, so just leave me alone! Damn it, why hasn't this parasite contacted me yet?"  The man's frustration is evident in both his words and his expression. "Luascans.com" 
8.9.B.jpg;  "He's telling me to do it. What?"  The man slams his phone down, anger and frustration boiling over. "Luascans.com"
8.9.C.jpg;   "Monitor | 3rd place, Mr. Jeong Gil-gaon, enters."  The black shoes step into the room, signifying the arrival of a powerful figure. 
8.9.D.0.jpg;   "Everyone!"  The man smiles, radiating warmth and positivity. "How have you all been?"
8.9.D.1.jpg;   The man stands confidently, his tablet held securely in his hand, projecting an aura of professionalism and authority. 
8.10.A.0.jpg;  "Monitor room | 6th place, Mr. Hwang-hoon, enters."  The text on the screen reveals a heartfelt conversation, filled with concern and care.  "Ah, Mom! Okay, I'll take care of my health." 
8.10.A.1.jpg;  The screen displays a contrasting perspective on health. "What's the point of health supplements! If I don't eat flour for even a day, I feel weak." 
8.10.B.0.jpg;  "Do you want to see your youngest son being weak like this?" he snarled into the phone, his anger evident in his voice. 
8.10.B.1.jpg; "Uh, sir. The door is open." the man with short, dark hair spoke calmly. "Oh, yes, Mr. Kim. I'm a bit busy right now, so let's discuss our ruthless business later, okay?" the tattooed man replied, his expression unchanged.
8.10.C.jpg;  He gaped in disbelief, "As expected, it's the 9th stage of the tutorial season!"  His eyes widened as he scanned the faces, "White Lion, Alpha, Twilight, and they even came personally..." 
8.10.D.jpg; "The competition for new talent scouts will be fierce." the man in the white jacket said. "I wonder if another S-class will come out again?" the man on the stool mused, "There are still only four of them, right? Rock, Twilight, David, and..."
8.10.E.jpg; The screen flickered with anticipation as the names scrolled by, "Monitor | 7th place, Mr. Beom, enters. Monitor | Anonymous enters."
8.11.A.jpg;  The man in the dark brown jacket stood in the shadows, his back turned to the blue-haired man who observed him intently. 
8.11.B.0.jpg;  The man with the gray hair sat in the darkness, his expression etched with seriousness.  
8.11.B.1.jpg;  The man in the black jacket stood tall, his back to the viewer, while the hooded man watched him from behind, his gaze fixed on the floor.
8.11.C.jpg;  "Wow, it's Beom. He's so cool..." the man whispered in awe, his eyes wide with surprise. "As expected, there is no way the Silver Lion's right arm can't be restored again."
8.11.D.jpg;  The man in the black hoodie walked away, his steps deliberate. The man with blonde hair watched him go, his expression one of shock. 
8.12.A.0.jpg;  "If the other hunters get to it first, our profits would dwindle." she exclaimed.
8.12.A.1.jpg;  His eyes widened in fear as he peered down at the hooded figure, its golden eyes gleaming ominously from beneath the cloak. 
8.12.B.jpg;  The man with pink hair sat confidently on the step, his gaze unwavering, while the man to his right looked bored and the man to his left had a blank expression. 
8.13.A.0.jpg;  She stood surrounded by red circles, her expression a mix of sadness and boredom.  
8.13.A.1.jpg;  The man walked with purpose, his confidence radiating from his every step.
8.13.B.jpg;  The man on the step looked confused, his brow furrowed, while the man in the foreground watched with concern. "Luascans.com" was written beneath the man on the step. 
8.13.C.jpg;  He leaned back, a smug smile on his face, "Luascans.com" was written beneath him.
8.14.A.jpg;  The hooded figure stood in the shadows, its presence exuding mystery and intimidation. 
8.14.B.0.jpg;  She reached up to pull her hood back, revealing her playful purple eyes and a slight smile.
8.14.B.1.jpg;   His eyes narrowed in annoyance, "These people..." he muttered under his breath. 
8.14.C.jpg; Her hooded eyes, tinged with purple-blue, scanned the surroundings with suspicion and determination. 
9.0.A.jpg;  The hooded figure stood alone, their face hidden, a somber mood hanging heavy as they pondered, "To support us!"
9.0.B.0.jpg;  She pulled her hood further down, her eyes widening with apprehension, her heart pounding with nervousness. 
9.0.B.1.jpg;   "These bastards..."  the voice hissed, filled with anger. 
9.0.C.jpg;  Her hooded eyes, tinged with purple-blue, scanned the surroundings with suspicion and determination. 
9.0.D.jpg;  "They're so perceptive." the text read,  a sense of surprise and apprehension hanging in the air.
9.1.A.jpg;  "This is why I don't like hunters who are quick on the uptake." the hooded figure spoke, their voice a low growl. The man with purple hair sat nervously, his eyes wide with fear, while the man with red hair and sunglasses remained silent, a sense of tension gripping the room.  
9.1.B.jpg;  She lowered her gaze, her expression one of doubt and uncertainty. "I was confident with my mana control, but this might be..." she whispered.  
9.1.C.0.jpg;  The computer screen glowed with a blue light, displaying a map of sorts, its lines and shapes a blur of confusion.  "Just now." the screen announced.
9.1.C.1.jpg;  Three light blue boxes appeared on the screen, welcoming Geon Ji-rok to the Babylon Tower.  "First-time visitor." the first box declared. "Welcome to the Babylon Tower. Welcome, Geon Ji-rok." the second box read. The third box, however, brought a wave of disappointment, "Access to all floors except the ground floor is temporarily restricted due to tutorial progress." 
9.2.A.0.jpg;  The young person with purple hair stood in the digital space, their black hoodie emblazoned with the words "no idea what you're talking about."  They moved through the swirling blue lines and symbols, their expression serious, as if a storm was brewing.
9.2.A.1.jpg;  Their blue sandals landed on the digital floor, a blue and white rectangle appearing above their feet. "Ranked 2nd, Geon Ji-rok can access the monitoring room as one of the leading figures in the Babylon."  Another rectangle appeared below, "Would you like to enter?" with options "y / n."
9.2.B.0.jpg;  A rush of excitement filled the air as three blue and white rectangles appeared above the purple-haired person's head. "The authority of the vice leader, 'Fate Reader', is partially released!" the top rectangle declared.  "The unique divine ability of Geon Ji-rok, the 'True Divine', has been adjusted." the middle one read. The bottom rectangle confirmed, "The divine name, 'Sage of Knowledge', resonates with the Babylon Tower!"
9.2.B.1.jpg;  Their eyes widened in surprise, a blue and white rectangle appearing above their head. "The first title, 'The Witch Queen', resonates with the Babylon Tower!"  
9.3.A.jpg;  The person with purple hair stood in awe, bathed in a bright white light, surrounded by blue and white squares. The sudden transportation to this digital world left them feeling both excited and confused.
9.3.B.0.jpg;  They looked down, their expression a mix of confusion and concern. "Why are they rising so much?" a blue and white rectangle whispered behind them.
9.3.B.1.jpg;  Only the top of their head and shoulder were visible, their mouth slightly open in shock.  "This one's a buff, and that one's a buff...!" the text below read.
9.3.C.0.jpg;  "This is totally sweet, isn't it?" the text exclaimed, a sense of excitement and amusement radiating from the words.
9.3.C.1.jpg;  The person in the gray cloak and blue cape stood, their face hidden, a nervous excitement in their posture.  "Your divine power, the 'Fate Reader', says the door will open soon." a blue and white rectangle announced above their head.  "Sweating at the thought of leading a secluded life." another rectangle read below.
9.3.D.jpg;  Their purple irises, surrounded by blue light, held a fierce determination.  "Of leading a secluded life." the text above their eyes declared. 
9.3.E.jpg;  The man in the hooded jacket lay on the ground, his eyes wide with shock as a bright light shone above him. "Oops." he gasped. 
9.3.F.0.jpg;  The man in the black suit stood, his back to the viewer, as the man in the blue hooded jacket hung his head in defeat. "I let my guard down." he mumbled. 
9.3.F.1.jpg;  She stood, arms crossed, her expression one of disgust. "Even for a pro like me who's used to being on top..." she muttered.
9.4.A.0.jpg;  The person stood in the darkness, their head bowed in thought.  "Like me who's used to milking buffs, this is a surprising situation." they sighed. "The reason why Byul-nim urged me to go to the tower makes sense now."
9.4.A.1.jpg;  They stood on the stairs, their back to the viewer, a sense of realization and concern in their posture. "Some of them seem to have caught on to my identity." they whispered. 
9.4.B.jpg;  The person in the black jacket smirked, while the person in the white robe smiled brightly, holding two pink and blue light sticks.  "Well, those on Channel 1 here will surely keep it a secret." the person in white said.  "If there is a crazy person who speaks out, justice will be served, right?"  They continued, "Do whatever you want, my baby. If the rice cakes get tough, you can just stir them to soften them."
9.4.C.0.jpg;  The person in the black hooded jacket stood in the room, their gaze fixed on the window, a sense of determination and anticipation radiating from them.  
9.4.C.1.jpg;   They walked up the stairs, their posture confident,  "I guess it's time to recalibrate my mana." they said.  "Now, there's only one worry left." 
9.4.D.jpg;  They stood in the darkness, the bright light behind them illuminating their sharp profile.  Their expression was serious, focused,  a sense of power emanating from their very presence. 
9.4.E.0.jpg;  The person sat in the chair, their eyes wide in surprise, two glowing beams of light emanating from them.  "Is it just Cyclops Crazy Night Rain..." they whispered. 
9.4.E.1.jpg; A beam of energy shoots towards her, catching her off guard. 
9.5.A.0.jpg; He smiles, "Looks like you've improved your homemaking skills, huh?" 
9.5.A.1.jpg; He speaks to the woman standing behind him, his words coming out slowly and deliberately.
9.5.B.0.jpg; He frowns, " ... i don't know who you are." 
9.5.B.1.jpg; He raises his hand, "but what you're doing right now is rude... ahn chi-san."
9.5.C.jpg; His eye widens as he reacts to something unexpected. 
9.6.A.jpg; The woman's eyes widen in surprise. 
9.6.B.jpg;  He laughs, a smug look on his face. 
9.6.C.0.jpg;  He sits, a small smile on his face, "still the same. it's been a while. how have you been?"
9.6.C.1.jpg;  The woman lies on the floor, her eyes closed, "until this morning."  
9.6.D.0.jpg;  He stares intently, "you must be planning something big to make a move by yourself this time."
9.6.D.1.jpg; He smiles, "you've learned a good lesson at your old age."
9.7.A.0.jpg;  They whisper amongst themselves, "throne... king?"  "those guys... they can probably hear us talking like this."
9.7.A.1.jpg;  "We should block them." the woman says. 
9.7.B.0.jpg;  The woman points a finger, "don't complain, old man."
9.7.B.1.jpg; He sits with arms crossed, "what's the point of doing anything with this worn-out body?" "do you really want to go straight to the morgue?" 
9.7.C.jpg; He looks desperately around, "yeah, how long do i have?"
9.7.D.jpg; She looks down, her face filled with sadness. 
9.7.E.jpg; 'libraryfication'
9.8.A.0.jpg;  "hourglass of fate" sub-skill - reveals the remaining lifespan of the designated target. 
9.8.A.1.jpg;  She stares intently, "if it's long, 2 years. if it's short?"  She looks at the hourglass, "... "
9.8.B.jpg;  "... 1 year."
9.8.C.0.jpg;  He bows, "you must be geon ji-rok, nice to meet you. i'm eun seok-won."
