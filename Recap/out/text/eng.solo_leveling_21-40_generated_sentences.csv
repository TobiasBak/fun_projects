24.20.B.jpg;  The man, clad in armor,  stands firm,  his sword raised in defense,  a blue aura swirling around it.  His determined expression reflects his unwavering resolve. 
24.21.A.jpg;  The two men,  dressed in black shirts and blue jackets,  stand close,  their faces a mix of confusion and anger.  The man on the left holds the other's arm,  a blue glow emanating from his hand,  a sign of the tension between them. 
24.21.B.jpg; The man,  his brown curly hair a blur of motion,  charges forward,  his blue scarf trailing behind him.  His determined expression and blue aura suggest a focused,  powerful attack.
24.23.A.jpg;  The two men,  their black shirts stark against the blue background,  clash in a whirlwind of motion.  The man on the right,  his blue eyes glowing,  blocks the attack with a powerful hand. 
24.23.B.jpg;  The man with brown curly hair,  his face contorted in fear,  points with a trembling hand,  blood trickling from his nose.  The man in the blue jacket,  his expression steely,  stands ready. 
24.23.C.jpg;  The man,  his brown hair a blur,  charges forward,  his movement a blur of speed.  His determination is evident in his stance. 
24.24.A.jpg;  The man,  his face a mask of shock and fear,  stands amidst the blue light.  "H-how is an F-rank moving like this?"  he gasps.  "My attacks aren't hitting!"  he cries,  "He's too fast!"
24.24.B.jpg;  The man,  his red eyes blazing,  stands in the blue environment,  his words carrying a weight of disappointment.  "If you guys are hunters then try hunting." he says. 
24.25.A.jpg;  The man,  his blue eyes piercing,  stares forward,  his mouth open in a silent growl.  "Hunters were made to hunt anyway."  he thinks,  his determination unshakable. 
24.25.B.jpg; The man,  his face contorted in fear,  looks up,  his left shoulder stained red.  "Effect: paralysis has activated."  the words above him confirm the terrifying truth.  "Ahh!" he screams. 
24.26.A.jpg;  The red-haired man,  goggles perched on his forehead,  grinned widely.  "Magic?" he asked,  "Is it magic?"  The man in the purple cloak,  his face contorted with fury,  spat out the words,  "That son of a bitch!"
24.26.B.jpg;  The man,  his brown hair tousled,  stared in disbelief,  his mouth agape.  "S... strong." he whispered.
24.26.C.jpg;  The man in the blue cloak,  his face hidden,  held a small knife,  his arm outstretched.  "I think he's stronger."  he said,  "Than when he fought the dungeon boss."
24.27.A.0.jpg;  The man,  covered in blood,  groaned in pain.  "Kuah!" he yelled,  "Effect: bleed has activated."  the words above him confirmed the injury.  The man with brown hair,  his hair glowing yellow,  looked on,  his face contorted with shock and pain.  "Effect: paralysis has activated."  a voice whispered,  "Ku." 
24.27.A.1.jpg;  The man,  his dark blue hood pulled tight,  yelled in disbelief,  his eyes wide with shock.  "W-what is this guy's identity?!"  he exclaimed. 
24.28.A.jpg; The black sword,  its blue edge glowing brightly,  sliced through the air,  blood splattering around it.  "Effect: paralysis has activated." the words above it announced the sword's power. 
24.28.B.jpg;  The man,  his blue jacket blending into the darkness,  walked away,  a knife in hand,  his face impassive.  Multiple figures lay on the ground,  their fates unknown.
24.30.A.0.jpg; The man,  his face a mixture of shock and fear,  stared forward,  his mouth agape.  "I..." he whispered.
24.30.A.1.jpg; The man, his face contorted in disbelief,  looked up,  his eyes wide with fear.  "In a flash,  all our members...?!"  he exclaimed.
24.30.B.jpg;  The two men,  cloaked in blue,  stood in a tense standoff.  "You bastard, you were hiding your skills!"  one shouted.  "Was it you who dispatched the dungeon boss?" he accused.   The other man,  his back to the viewer,  looked surprised,  his eyes reflecting the gravity of the situation.  "Enemies required to be killed: 1.  Enemies killed: 7."  the words below confirmed the grim reality. 
24.31.A.jpg;  "I didn't expect all my members to be defeated." he muttered, his fists clenched tightly. The man's anger burned hotter than the sun, fueled by a burning desire to prove his strength.
24.31.B.jpg;  "Empower!" The man screamed in pain, his body wracked with the force of the attack. He was in shock, struggling to process what had just happened.
24.33.A.jpg; "No matter how much of a monster he is, there's no way he won't be tired after fighting a dungeon boss and seven hunters!" he shouted.  He lunged forward, his sword raised high, ready to strike.
24.33.B.jpg; "A hunter specializing in agility and dexterity!" he sneered. "He shouldn't have a skill that can pierce my empower skill! He will be destroyed the moment he hits me!"  His eyes gleamed with arrogance, his grip on the dagger unwavering.
24.34.A.jpg; "Leader Hwang Dong-Suk, you're strong." he said, his eyes filled with admiration. The man's words seemed to surprise the other, leaving him speechless for a moment. 
24.34.B.jpg; "But there's one thing you don't know." he said.  The man's surprise was evident, his brows furrowed in confusion.
24.35.A.0.jpg; The man lay on the ground, his body wracked with pain. He was injured, his face contorted in agony, his eyes squeezed shut.
24.35.A.1.jpg; The man stood over his opponent, his eyes burning with determination.  He raised his hand, a surge of energy flowing through him, and with a powerful wave, shattered the rocks surrounding them.
24.36.A.jpg;  "I'm always leveling up ceaselessly." he coughed, blood staining his neck. The cave echoed with his pain, the air thick with urgency and distress.
24.36.B.jpg; "W... what just happened?" he muttered, his eyes wide with disbelief. "Did he just slam me into the ground?" He lay there, his mind racing, trying to make sense of the events that had unfolded. 
24.37.A.jpg; "This guy... there's no way he's an E-Rank!" he exclaimed, disbelief lacing his voice. "Does that mean he's a false ranker?!" He looked at the terrified man on the ground, his eyes cold and calculating.
24.38.A.jpg; "Spare me!" he pleaded. "I- I'll give you money! You can have all the mana crystals here and the magic crystals too!"  His desperation was palpable, his outstretched arms a testament to his fear.
24.38.B.jpg;  "Three times." he growled, his eyes burning with fury. "Are you asking for forgiveness from someone you tried to kill three times?"  His anger was a tangible force, filling the air around him.
24.39.A.jpg;  "S... stop it!" he gasped, his eyes wide with shock. "You, do you think you'll get away with this?!"  His face contorted with fear.
24.39.B.jpg; "Didn't you say that... nobody knows what happens inside a dungeon?" he murmured, his gaze fixed on the shocked man. He was lost in thought, his mind struggling to comprehend what he had just witnessed.
24.40.A.0.jpg; "You bastard!" he roared, his face twisted with fury. His anger was palpable, his teeth bared in a snarl.
24.40.A.1.jpg; "Do you even know who my little brother is..." he yelled.  His anger was a force to be reckoned with, his words dripping with venom.
24.41.A.0.jpg; The black sphere whirled through the air, a deadly projectile, leaving a trail of crimson in its wake. The air crackled with energy, the sphere a harbinger of danger.
24.41.A.1.jpg; He launched himself forward, his sword a blur of motion.  His kick connected with his opponent, sending the man flying through the air, a bloody splatter painting the ground.
24.42.A.jpg;  The blood splattered across the blue background, a testament to the violence that had just transpired. The air was heavy with the scent of blood, the scene a stark reminder of the dangers lurking in the shadows. 
24.42.B.jpg; "My clothes became a mess again." he thought, glancing down at the blood splattered on his jacket. "The size isn't matching anymore, so I guess I'll buy a few new clothes." He sat there, lost in thought, contemplating the events that had just unfolded. 
24.44.A.jpg; The boy stood frozen, his eyes wide with fear, his head in his hands.  He was helpless, his purple eyes reflecting the terror he felt.
24.44.B.jpg;  The boy's eyes bulged, his mouth agape, drool escaping his lips. The sight before him was shocking, leaving him speechless and disgusted.
24.44.C.jpg; "...." he thought, his eyes fixed on the battlefield.  His expression remained calm, a testament to his resolve, his mind focused on the task at hand.
24.45.A.jpg; "The boss was defeated, the dungeon is closing." he said. "Let's leave quickly."  He looked at the giant spider, a wave of relief washing over him, and at the man beside him, a sense of shared purpose uniting them.
24.45.B.jpg;  He looked up, his eyes filled with fear, his body tense with anticipation. He was in the middle of a fight, his survival hanging in the balance. 
24.46.A.jpg;  He had completed the quest, the reward a tantalizing prospect. He was ready to accept the rewards he had earned, his anticipation building with each passing moment.
24.46.B.jpg;  He had the power to choose, the rewards within his grasp. He had to decide which path to take, the possibilities endless, each option a potential advantage.
24.46.C.jpg;  "Bloodlust." he read, his eyes reflecting the power of the skill. He could feel a surge of confidence, the strength coursing through his veins, a new weapon in his arsenal.
24.47.A.jpg; The city stretched out before him, a breathtaking expanse of towering buildings. He felt a sense of awe and excitement, the energy of the city palpable, a world of possibilities waiting to be explored. 
24.48.A.jpg; "A great morning." he mumbled, stretching his arms and looking towards the door.  "What time is it in Korea?" he wondered, rolling over in bed.
24.48.B.jpg; "Huh." he said, his brow furrowed in confusion. "Did I have a bad dream?" He sat there, his mind racing, trying to make sense of the disjointed memories that plagued him.
24.48.C.jpg; "My eyes are wet." he whispered, staring out the window at the city skyline. He was lost in thought, his heart heavy with sadness and regret.
24.49.A.jpg; He sat on the edge of the bed, his hands resting on his legs. The bright light from the window illuminated the room, creating a sense of privacy and intimacy. 
24.49.B.jpg; The title of the manhwa shimmered, beckoning the reader into a world of mystery and excitement. The gothic font added a touch of intrigue, promising a story filled with adventure and suspense.
25.0.A.jpg; The towering building stood against the azure sky, a symbol of grandeur and importance.  "Manager Yoo Jin-Cheul." the text below announced, highlighting the man's status and power.
25.0.B.jpg;  He leaned back in his chair, a smirk playing on his lips.  His eyes gleamed with confidence, his sharp jawline a testament to his determination.
25.1.A.jpg; "A moment." the smiling man said, holding up a piece of paper.  "What is it?" the other man asked, his brow furrowed with concern. 
25.1.B.jpg; "In this C-Rank dungeon raid, eight people were killed in action." the seated man said.  "The survivors were a D-Rank and an E-Rank hunter." the standing man added, his tone serious.
25.2.A.jpg; "Looks like they ran away. Isn't it a common occurrence?" the man asked, his eyes scanning the report.  "No. They didn't run. They cleared the dungeon." he said, surprise evident in his voice. 
25.2.B.jpg; His eyes widened in surprise, his pupils dilating. He was stunned, his mind struggling to process the information he had just received.
25.2.C.jpg; "The D-Rank, Yoo Jin-Ho's equipment was especially high-class, so it's possible that a C-Rank boss was defeated by him." the man with dark hair said.  The man with purple hair grinned, his golden suit gleaming under the office lights, a sense of amusement in his eyes.
25.3.A.jpg; "The boss, Giant Arachnid Buryura, shouldn't have been much of a threat to organized parties, so it's strange that eight people died." he muttered, clutching the paper in his hand. His face was etched with concern, a sense of unease settling over him.
25.4.A.jpg; "Don't beat around the bush and tell me." the man with dark hair demanded, his tone impatient.  "If there wasn't a really strange part, you wouldn't have consulted me and taken care of it yourself." the man with blond hair countered.  "Well." the man with dark hair sighed, his frustration evident.
25.4.B.jpg;  "The other survivor was Hunter Sung Jin-Woo from that dungeon incident." he said, his eyes widening in surprise. "Sung Jin-Woo." he repeated, his jaw dropping in shock.
25.5.A.jpg; "It seems like there are suspicious parts, but it's unnecessary to worry." the man with blond hair reassured.  "The magic strength measurement device we used then was a super-high class one that dropped from A-Rank monsters." the man with dark hair explained. "Awakenings aren't even that common, and there's no need to be suspicious of him again. Checking once will do."  A sigh of relief escaped his lips. 
25.5.B.jpg; "I also want to think it's a coincidence, but I can't just let this go." he said.  "Because one of the warriors happened to be..." he trailed off, his mind racing.
25.5.C.jpg; "The hunter 'Hwang Dong-Suk'." he read from the screen, his brow furrowed in confusion. "Hwang Dong-Suk?" he repeated. "Perhaps... are you talking about Hunter Hwang Dong-Su's older brother?" 
25.6.A.jpg; "In that case..." he said. his gaze unwavering.  His mind was already formulating a plan, his instincts telling him that this was no ordinary situation.
25.6.B.jpg; "I can't just ignore this." he declared. his eyes burning with determination.  He wouldn't let this situation slip through his fingers, his resolve hardening with each passing moment. 
25.7.A.jpg; "Why chicken wings?" he wondered, staring at the greasy box of food.  The night air was cool, the city lights twinkling in the distance.
25.8.A.jpg; "Did something good happen?" the woman asked, her eyes wide with surprise. "Well, I'm not sure if it's good or bad yet..." he mumbled, taking a sip from his can.  "Wow, what happened? You're usually so stingy." she said, her smile widening.
25.8.B.jpg; "I want to get drunk, but the feeling isn't coming." he thought, frowning at the untouched glass in his hand.  "Alarm - [A harmful substance has been detected.] [Buff: Cure Poison's effect is healing you]" the system announced, a wave of concern washing over him.
25.9.A.jpg; "Because of the special ability that the system gave me, even alcohol is being purified." he explained, taking another sip from the bottle. The woman smiled, her eyes twinkling with amusement. 
25.9.B.0.jpg;  "3, 2, 1...... Cure Poison has been completed." the screen announced, a wave of excitement washing over him.  "A reward the system gave me as soon as I woke up after making it through the dungeon disaster." he read, a thrill coursing through him. "Alarm - [You have completed all the necessary requirements of the secret quest 'Courage of the Weak']" 
25.9.B.1.jpg;  "Since there's a lot to take in recently, I just overlooked it..." he muttered, his eyes widening in surprise. "Alarm - [If he fails to obey the system's orders, there may be a penalty.]"  "Alarm - [Your rewards have arrived]" The system's messages flashed on the screen, a sense of urgency gripping him.
25.11.A.0.jpg; "To think it gave me this as reward." he said, his face beaming with joy.  "Quest Reward - 'Secret Quest: Courage of the Weak' - Great Spellcaster Kandiaru's Blessing: The great spellcaster Kandiaru has gifted a special spell to you. Kandiaru's Blessing will ensure that you will always be strong and healthy during your lifetime."  The words glowed on the screen, a testament to his accomplishment.
25.11.A.1.jpg;  "If the other hunters get to it first, our profits would dwindle." he thought, his eyes scanning the card.  He was satisfied, his mind racing with the possibilities this new power opened up. 
25.11.B.jpg; "If I'm immune to all poisons..." he thought, a flicker of understanding dawning on him. "Wait..." he said.
25.12.A.jpg; "Aren't you eating? If you don't eat, I'll eat it for you!" he teased, a playful smirk on his face. "Feel free to gain weight." he added, his tone lighthearted. The woman blushed, her eyes twinkling with amusement. She continued to eat the fruit, her smile widening. 
25.12.B.jpg; "It's hard to adjust to him after he started training." she mused, chewing thoughtfully on the chicken wing.  "He was easy-going before, and it seems like his personality changed a bit... I think he looks sharper than before too... Is it because he's working out? Exercise can do anything." she wondered, her brow furrowed with concern.
25.13.A.jpg; "It's not like something happened in a dungeon, right?" he muttered. He stood near the door, his mind racing, trying to make sense of the situation.
25.13.B.jpg;  "If status effects are automatically healed, won't this item's debuff be removed as well?" he thought, examining the pouch. He was confused, the implications of this new power swirling in his mind. 
25.13.C.jpg;  "There's no reason to think." he declared, his jaw set in determination. He took a bite of the chicken, his eyes focused on the task at hand. 
25.14.A.jpg; "A harmful substance has been detected in your body." the screen read. "3, 2, 1...... Cure Poison has been completed." it announced. He breathed a sigh of relief, the poison purged from his system.
25.14.B.jpg;  "Item: Rasaka's Venom's effect Weakened Muscles is fading." the screen announced.  "It's just as I thought." he said. He knew this would happen, his confidence unshaken.
25.14.C.jpg; "Do you know anyone called Yoo Jin-Ho?" the woman asked.  "Who?" he asked, his eyes widening in surprise. "He's calling for you on the phone." she said, handing him the phone.
25.16.A.jpg; "Sir, over here!" he called out, waving his hand. He sat at a table in the cafe, his friendly smile inviting the other man to join him.
25.16.B.jpg; "I have a few connections in the guild." the man on the right said, a knowing look in his eyes. The man in the brown hoodie was taken aback, his brow furrowing in surprise.
25.17.A.jpg; "I'm fine." the man in the brown hoodie said. "Do you want a cup of coffee?" the man on the right offered.  They sat in silence, the cafe's gentle hum filling the air. 
25.17.B.jpg;  "I didn't expect to meet you again." the man on the left said, a wide grin spreading across his face. "You're my savior." the man on the right added, his eyes filled with gratitude.  The cafe buzzed around them, their conversation a quiet haven amidst the bustling crowd. 
25.18.A.jpg; "Well, you shared all the magic crystals with me, so I earned some money." the man with black hair said.  He looked at the bag filled with blue crystals, his mind focused on the task at hand.  "It totals to 1 million and 8 thousand won minus tax." the man on the right announced, his fingers flying across the keyboard.
25.18.B.jpg;  "Also, since you kept quiet, there's been no problems so far." he said, a smug smirk on his face. He leaned back in his chair, enjoying the feeling of power and control. 
25.19.A.jpg; "T... those guys tried to kill us first." he stammered.  He couldn't shake the feeling of dread, the memory of the attack still fresh in his mind.
25.19.B.jpg;  "We're hunters, so we can't just die easily..." the man on the left said.  "It was a fight among hunters." the man on the right added, his tone matter-of-fact.
25.20.A.0.jpg; "This guy is a false ranker." the man on the right whispered, his eyes wide with shock.  "A maniac that enjoys murdering and killing!"  He lowered his voice, his words laced with a mix of fear and disgust.  "Normally, he's not a person I should ever become involved with..." 
25.20.A.1.jpg;  "So, why did you request to meet me?" he asked, his brow furrowed in curiosity.  He leaned forward, his eyes fixed on the other man, his mind trying to piece together the puzzle. 
25.20.B.jpg;  He sat there, his hands clasped tightly on his knees, his face etched with worry.  He was deep in thought, the weight of the situation bearing down on him.
25.21.A.jpg; "Sir..." he exclaimed, his eyes wide with alarm.  His voice trembled, his face a mask of fear and surprise.
25.21.B.0.jpg; "I'm actually planning to create a personal attack..." he thought, his gaze unwavering.  "Declined." the system responded, his determination unwavering. 
25.21.B.1.jpg; "B... but. I didn't even..." he mumbled. He hung his head, his shoulders slumping with disappointment.
25.23.A.0.jpg; "Finish sentence??!" the man shouted. "I don't need to hear it." he said, his tone curt. "Since you're creating an attack force, you want me to enter."  He looked at the man with a mixture of confusion and alarm. "S-sir!"
25.23.A.1.jpg;  "I was wondering what it was, but I have no intention to play around with a rich kid." he said. "I'm going if there's nothing else." He turned and walked towards the round table, his confidence unwavering. 
25.23.B.jpg; "Just 20 times!" he insisted.  "No. Please go with me just 19 times!" he pleaded, his hand resting heavily on the table.  He wouldn't take no for an answer, his determination unwavering. 
25.24.A.jpg; "Where dungeons?" he asked, his eyes gleaming with confidence.  "Yes! I'll give you your share properly." he assured. 
25.24.B.jpg; "You should know based on the last incident." he said.  "Hunters can not only kill monsters, but humans just as easily." he added, his tone grave. "Raids aren't just extreme sports." "Even so, you're going to create an attack force?"  "Are you right in the mind to say that even after seeing such a terrifying scene?" he asked.
25.25.A.jpg; "Could it be..." he whispered, his brow furrowed with intrigue and concern.  His mind raced, trying to piece together the fragments of information, his intuition telling him that something wasn't quite right. 
25.26.A.jpg;  "Yes, sir!" he exclaimed, his face flushed with excitement.  He stood there, his eyes gleaming with determination, eager to prove his worth. 
25.26.B.jpg; "Please at least listen to what I have to say." he sobbed, his head resting on the table.  The man on the left looked down at him with concern, his hand resting gently on his friend's arm.
25.27.A.jpg;  "As you said, I want to receive a license to become a guild master." he said. "It's not hard for hunters to receive a guild master license." he added, his tone reassuring.  He leaned back in his chair, his eyes focused on the pile of papers before him. 
25.27.B.jpg; "The hunter must participate in a raid at least 20 times." he said, his eyes sparkling with excitement.  "The first one, I already went through last time." he explained, holding up two fingers.  "Now I have 19 raids left to attend." he added, a hopeful grin on his face. 
25.28.A.jpg; "Of course there's an examination, but if I didn't have a good brain, I wouldn't be able to inherit the company, so I have confidence in that." the man on the right said, his grin widening.  The man on the left merely stared at him, a bored expression on his face. "......"
25.28.B.jpg; "Thinking about it, you were Yoo-Jin Architectures' second son." the man on the left said.  "Yes." the man on the right confirmed, his eyes widening in surprise.  "Me becoming a guild master is actually related to our company as well." he added. 
25.28.C.jpg; "My father wants to create a guild." he said. "Yoo-Jin Architectures." he added, his tone firm, his mind already racing with plans. 
25.29.A.0.jpg; "Dungeons are dangerous, but proportional to that they contain mountains of treasures." the text announced, a sense of mystery and wonder filling the air.  "Magic crystals or mana crystals are just a few." the text continued, the ice crystals reflecting the vibrant colors of the background.  "Monster corpses are used as material as well, so there's nothing useless in dungeons." the text proclaimed, highlighting the bounty that awaited those brave enough to venture into the unknown.  "Of course, major companies get involved." the text concluded, revealing the complex web of power and influence that surrounded these perilous realms. 
25.29.A.1.jpg;  "So the hunters that work at the company complete the dungeon, and the company takes the rewards." he explained, his eyes fixed on the monstrous creature.  "So they're planning on becoming self-sufficient." he mused, a hint of admiration in his voice. "That's correct, sir!"
25.30.A.jpg; "My father is planning to employ an S-Rank hunter and set him as the master." he said. "My brother will be the vice master and operate the guild under the guise of contributing." he added, his eyes wide with disbelief.
25.30.B.0.jpg; "If I'm correct, there are only 9 S-Rank hunters within our country." he thought, his brow furrowed in concern. "If he plans on employing a hunter not registered in a guild, that only leaves Hunter Min Beong-Gyu... but didn't he retire?" he wondered, his mind racing. "Even if your brother is going to..." 
25.30.B.1.jpg;  "To become the vice master, the authority difference is too big." he thought, his mind working overtime.  "Friction between the two probably can't be avoided." he mused, a sense of unease settling over him. "Yes, my brother is talented, but without being reawakened, he is strong enough for the seat of the guild master." 
25.31.A.jpg; "Are you planning to gain some experience and then consult your father?" the man with black hair asked, his tone curious.  "With a low rank and age, someone like you, with no experience, couldn't become involved." the man in the white shirt said, his smile unwavering. "Yes, that's correct, sir." the man with black hair replied. 
25.32.A.0.jpg; "The fact that you're a false ra... i mean the fact that you hide your abilities will be kept a secret by me forever!"  He shouted. Despite his injuries, the man's eyes held a resolute fire, a reflection of the determination burning within him. 
25.32.A.1.jpg;  "An attack." the man mused. Leaning against the table, his fingers tapped rhythmically against the surface, as if lost in thought. 
25.32.B.jpg;  "Sir is at least a B-rank...or even higher than that." he murmured,  the weight of the statement heavy in the air. The man sat alone, lost in contemplation, his thoughts swirling around the implications of his newfound knowledge. 
25.33.A.jpg;  "An E-rank hunter, but he dispatched a C-rank boss and several C-rank hunters without a scratch." he muttered, his gaze fixed on the ground, lost in thought. His mind raced,  juggling the conflicting information,  the man's apparent weakness contrasted with his surprising power.
25.34.A.jpg; "This..." the man with brown hair started, a question hanging in the air. The other man, his hood obscuring his expression,  looked at him with a mixture of confusion and skepticism,  his brow furrowed in uncertainty. 
25.34.B.jpg;  One eye, wide with shock, stared out,  a silent testament to the unexpected turn of events. The man's face remained hidden, the emotion concealed behind the shadow of his hood. 
26.0.A.jpg;  "This..." the man with ginger hair muttered, a deep frown etched on his face. The papers in his hand rustled slightly,  a testament to his anxiety.  The other man stood silently,  a sense of unease hanging heavily in the air.
26.1.A.jpg;  "Why are you suddenly following me out to exercise?" he asked,  a playful tone lacing his words. The man's leg was poised, his body ready to spring into action,  his energy radiating with excitement. 
26.2.A.jpg;  "You seem to be on your high horse lately." the man remarked, a mischievous glint in his eye. The woman stretched,  her limbs reaching towards the sky,  a carefree smile gracing her lips. "It's not good to sit at a desk for too long anyway." she replied. "Don't fall behind."  she added, a playful jab in her voice. 
26.3.A.jpg;  "Jin-ah." the man asked.  The woman paused,  her eyes reflecting a moment of thought. "Hypothetically, if you suddenly got 3,000,000,000 won, what would you do?" he continued,  a sense of wonder in his voice. "Why are you asking?"  she questioned, her brow slightly furrowed,  a hint of amusement in her tone. 
26.3.B.jpg;  "Maybe deposit it?" the man suggested.  "Or move to a bigger house?"  The woman, however,  seemed taken aback.  "Well... I haven't really thought of that..." she stammered, a bewildered look on her face. 
26.4.A.jpg;  "Aren't the numbers too unrealistic?" the man questioned,  his brow furrowed in confusion.  "Why 3 billion?" the woman echoed,  her eyes wide with surprise.  "It's not that..." the man mumbled,  a thoughtful expression clouding his features.
26.4.B.jpg; "...Unrealistic." The woman continued. "Hey... brother!" she called out. "Wait for me!" she added,  a mischievous grin spreading across her face. 
26.5.A.jpg;  "A hunter is a hunter though."  the woman said.   "3 billion?!" the man exclaimed,  his eyes wide with disbelief. 
26.5.B.jpg;  "It's the building we're constructing, and we plan on using it as the guild office." the document stated,  its purpose laid bare. "The estimated price is 3 billion, but it will rise."  it added,  a stark reminder of the hefty costs involved.
26.6.A.jpg;  "A 3,000,000,000 won building for doing C-rank raids nineteen times..."  the man mused, a confident smirk playing on his lips.  "So you're saying it's just a small investment as long as you can become a guild master?" he inquired.  "That is correct, sir." the ginger-haired man replied,  his tone unwavering.
26.6.B.jpg;  "What should I do?" the man muttered, his hand resting thoughtfully on his chin.  "3 billion." he repeated, the weight of the offer settling heavily upon him.  "Normally there would be no reason to refuse, but..." he trailed off,  his mind grappling with the implications of this unexpected opportunity. 
26.7.A.jpg;  "Unique."  he murmured,  his gaze fixed on the ground, lost in thought. "I am aware of it." he said. "I'm a special case even among the reawakened." he continued,  a sense of quiet pride lacing his words. "Since nobody has heard of a hunter that can level up and grow stronger." he added. "If I continue to level up like this, it's possible that I could reach S-rank, no, maybe something even stronger than that." he finished, his eyes reflecting a glimmer of ambition. 
26.7.B.jpg;  "If that happens, 3 billion is nothing." the man declared.  "But..." he paused,  a thoughtful expression replacing his earlier eagerness.  "I have a condition." he stated.  "You can tell me anything, sir!" he added,  his eyes filled with unwavering determination.  
26.8.A.0.jpg;  "You and me." the man said.  "We two, no one else goes." he added,  his gaze unwavering,  his mind set on the task ahead. 
26.8.A.1.jpg;  He flashed a relaxed peace sign,  his demeanor radiating confidence and ease. The man's eyes held a calm determination,  a reflection of his resolve to face any challenge head-on.
26.9.A.jpg;  "S... sir." the man stammered, his eyes widening in surprise.  "If I'm not misunderstanding... we have to clear C-rank dungeons by ourselves, is that what you're saying?" he asked.  "You understood perfectly." the man replied,  his tone unwavering. 
26.9.B.jpg;  "B-but to enter a C-rank gate there must be at least ten members..." the man protested,  a sense of unease creeping into his voice. "If we offer a reward just for filling up the head count, there will definitely be people lining up." the man explained. "We're using the method that Hwang Dong-suk used." he added,  a hint of mischief in his tone.
26.10.A.0.jpg; "B-but isn't it too dangerous, sir?" the man questioned, his brow furrowed with concern. "You can't put two and two together." the other man replied,  a hint of amusement in his voice.  "In other words, if we're fine, then nobody else will get hurt." he added,  his tone unwavering.
26.10.A.1.jpg;  "Think about it." the man said.  "Say we successfully completed nineteen raids after creating an attack force." he continued,  his eyes gleaming with ambition. "We become an attack force that came out safely nineteen times." he added.  "Won't it be helpful to showing your skill to your father?" he finished,  a knowing smile playing on his lips.  "I get it..."  the other man exclaimed, a newfound understanding dawning on his face. 
26.11.A.0.jpg;  "Let's do it that way, sir!" the man declared.  "I will recruit our teammates." he added,  a sense of purpose in his eyes.  "Alarm."  a mechanical voice announced, breaking the tension. "-Daily quest: [Preparing to become strong] has been completed."
26.11.A.1.jpg;  "Oops, I accidentally overdid it, because I was in thought." the man mumbled,  his face flushed with embarrassment. "-Push-ups [100/100]  -Curl-ups [100/100]  -Squats [100/100]  -Running [11/10km]."  the voice announced,  a testament to his unintentional overachievement. 
26.12.A.jpg;  "What happened to Jin-ah...?" the man asked. "Well, does it matter?" the other man replied,  a nonchalant shrug accompanying his words. 
26.12.B.jpg;  "-Push-ups [100/100] -Curl-ups [100/100] -Squats [100/100] -Running [11/10km]."  the mechanical voice announced,  its tone unwavering.  "Why is it recording even when I completed the goal?" the man questioned,  a confused frown etching his features. 
26.12.C.jpg;  "I have to wait for Jin-ah anyway, so should I fill it up as much as possible?"  the man mused, his eyes glinting with a determined spark.  
26.13.A.jpg;  "20 minutes later."  the voice announced,  a reminder of the passing time.  "-Push-ups [200/100]  -Curl-ups [200/100] -Squats [200/100] -Running [11/10km]."  it continued,  highlighting his progress.  "It's not going above 200." the man observed,  a confused frown etching his features. "Is it the same for running?" he asked, a sense of curiosity in his voice.
26.13.B.jpg;  "Since I can't run 200km, let's start with 20km." the man declared.  despite the absurdity of the situation.  "B-brother!" a worried voice called out,  a hint of panic lacing the words.
26.14.A.jpg; "Hey!!" the woman shouted.  A wave of annoyance washed over her face as she watched him run away.  
26.14.B.jpg;  The cityscape stretched out before him,  a canvas of twinkling lights against the velvet backdrop of the night.  The moon, a pale orb in the sky,  cast a gentle glow on the bustling city below.  "Washington, USA." the caption read,  a simple statement that held the weight of countless stories. 
26.15.A.jpg;  "Fax me the information of the two survivors, the number is..." the man said.  despite the late hour.  "Mister Hwang, what are you doing at this hour?" the woman asked.
26.15.B.jpg;  "Lola, can I ask you something?" the woman asked.  her eyes fixed on the man. 
26.15.C.jpg;  "Yes, anything."  the woman replied.  her eyes closed,  her body radiating a sense of resignation.  
26.17.A.jpg;  "What happens if I kill someone in Korea?"  the man wondered aloud. The printer hummed softly,  a silent witness to his internal struggle.
26.17.B.jpg; "Are you serious?" the woman asked,  a playful smirk gracing her lips. Her eyes twinkled with amusement,  a clear sign that she found the idea ludicrous. 
26.18.A.0.jpg;  "...Korea has not yet concluded the Indian treaty of criminal hunters." the woman stated. Her eyes held a seriousness that mirrored the weight of her words. 
26.18.A.1.jpg;  "Thank goodness." the man breathed a sigh of relief, his shoulders slumping with the weight lifted. His relaxed expression spoke volumes,  a testament to the weight that had been lifted from his shoulders. 
26.19.A.0.jpg;  "Some bastards killed my brother." the man snarled.  His eyes, filled with rage and grief,  held a burning intensity,  a reflection of the pain that consumed him. 
26.19.A.1.jpg;  "If I don't at least catch a glimpse of them, I won't be satisfied...!"  he growled, his hand clenching around the metal object, crushing it with a violent force. "S-rank hunter Hwang Dong-suk, Scavenger Guild."  the inscription read,  a stark reminder of his target. 
26.19.B.jpg;  "...Brother's seven squad members all died and the other two came out alive?" he murmured,  a deep frown etching his features.  "The survivor's ranks were D and E." he noted.  "Bro isn't the type of person to put his life on the line for weak teammates."  he added, his words laced with a heavy sense of disbelief. 
26.20.A.0.jpg; "...Also they were fillers, not normal team members." the woman continued.  "They must have set up a trap and killed him!" she exclaimed,  her eyes flashing with anger.  "That's why I told you that you can't do anything without me..." she added,  a sense of authority in her voice. "I'll have to visit Korea for a while, can..." she trailed off. 
26.20.A.1.jpg;  "You empty my schedule?" he asked. "But Mister Hwang, if you leave so suddenly, the guild will become paralyzed." the woman replied. 
26.21.A.jpg;  "When can you free some time?" the man asked.  "Around two weeks from now."  the woman replied,  her tone confident and unwavering. 
26.21.B.jpg;  "Two weeks... not even enough time for a proper funeral."  the man murmured. "Okay. Empty my schedule after that point." the woman replied. 
26.22.A.jpg;  "More than anything..." the man growled,  his fists clenched tightly,  his eyes burning with rage. "I wish that those bastards are still alive even after two weeks." he added.  
26.23.A.jpg;  The two profiles stood side by side,  a stark contrast in rank and experience. "D-rank hunter Yoo Jin-ho."  the top profile read, a simple statement that highlighted his relatively low standing.  "E-rank hunter Sung Jin-woo."  the bottom profile read,  a testament to his even lower status.  
26.23.B.jpg; The man stood tall, a silhouette against the backdrop of the city, his gaze unwavering. The full moon, a silent observer, cast its ethereal glow upon the scene,  a testament to the night's quiet power. 
26.24.A.jpg; The hunter stood poised, his dagger held in a practiced grip,  his eyes scanning the cityscape for any sign of danger.  The mist swirled around his feet,  a shroud of mystery cloaking his presence. 
26.24.B.jpg; He held the spear aloft, a symbol of his triumph.  The list on the wall,  a testament to his dedication,  bore witness to his accomplishment.  "After completing the goals twofold the daily quest turned into a 'hidden quest'."  he read aloud,  a sense of satisfaction in his voice. 
26.25.A.jpg; He stared at the key,  a sense of disappointment etched on his face.  "I expected that I would get a better reward than usual, but to think that I received an S-class item." he muttered. 
26.25.B.jpg; He scrutinized the digital display,  his mind racing as he considered his options.  "Are hidden quests only given when daily quests are done in excess?" he wondered aloud,  his brow furrowed in contemplation.  "This is a good chance." he mused,  a glimmer of determination in his eyes.  "Since I picked the 'blessed random box', I was not able to obtain the 'cursed random box'." he noted,  a sense of regret in his voice. 
26.26.A.jpg;  "Anyway, since I obtained a dungeon entry key, I have no choice but to go in." he declared.  He gripped the key tightly,  ready to face whatever awaited him within. 
26.26.B.jpg; The kanji,  a blazing symbol of power,  stood out against the urban backdrop. The air crackled with anticipation,  a palpable sense of excitement filling the atmosphere. 
26.27.A.jpg; The hooded figure stood, a silent sentinel,  his presence commanding respect,  his gaze fixed on the distant horizon. The weapon in his hand,  a chilling reminder of his power,  added to his intimidating aura. 
26.28.A.jpg;  The man reached out,  his hand outstretched,  a desperate attempt to ward off the searing energy.  His body,  wracked with pain,  glowed with an unnatural purple hue,  a testament to the ferocity of the attack. 
26.28.B.jpg;  The man stood firm,  his eyes narrowed,  his face etched with determination.  A yellow lightning bolt crackled behind him,  a symbol of his unwavering resolve.  "Of of of."  the inscription whispered, a haunting reminder of the power he wielded. 
26.29.A.0.jpg; "If a key's rarity is proportional to the dungeon's difficulty..." the text proclaimed,  a chilling reminder of the danger lurking within. The fiery explosion,  a testament to the power unleashed,  painted the urban landscape with a horrifying beauty. 
26.29.A.1.jpg;  The man turned,  his gaze fixed on the inferno consuming the cityscape. "This dungeon is S-rank!" the text above him announced,  a stark warning of the danger he faced.  "The chance of my survival is zero!" the text below him added,  a grim reminder of the overwhelming odds against him. 
26.30.A.jpg; "Of course, there is no indication that the item class is equivalent to the dungeon's difficulty." the text stated,  a subtle hint of uncertainty.  "But on the other hand... an instant dungeon entered with a rarity of E was as easy as an E-rank gate dungeon."  the text continued,  a thought-provoking observation.
26.30.B.jpg;  "Then what do I do if the rarity really indicates the difficulty of the dungeon?" he pondered,  his brow furrowed in concern.  "I have the Hearthstone that I didn't use in the last instant dungeon, so if things get dangerous, I'll use it right away." he reassured himself.  "The only thing I can do right now is to try my best." he concluded. 
26.31.A.jpg;  "From now on I have to clear C-rank dungeons with Jin-ho." the man declared,  a resolute glint in his eye.  "I must know my current strength."  he added,  his gaze fixed on the inferno raging before him. 
26.32.A.0.jpg;  "If I give up because I'm scared, I can't become stronger." the text proclaimed,  a powerful reminder of the need for courage.  "Hell's Gatekeeper Kerberos."  the inscription above the beast declared,  a chilling introduction to the fearsome creature. 
26.32.A.1.jpg; The man stood poised,  his knife held in a practiced grip,  his eyes locked on the beast.  "If the other hunters get to it first, our profits would dwindle." he muttered,  a hint of urgency in his voice. 
26.32.B.jpg;  "I'll become much stronger." he vowed.  His eyes,  burning with ambition,  reflected the fire that consumed him. 
27.0.A.jpg;  The man stood defiant,  his gaze unwavering,  his body radiating a sense of calm confidence.  "If I give up because I'm scared, I can't become stronger." the text whispered,  a reminder of the power within.  "Hell's Gatekeeper Cerberus." the inscription above the beasts declared, a chilling reminder of the formidable foes he faced.
27.0.B.jpg;  "I'll become much stronger." he repeated.  his determination solidifying with each word.  His eyes,  a beacon of ambition,  gleamed with an unyielding resolve.  
27.1.A.jpg; "A key that allows you to enter the Demon Castle." the inscription read, a sense of awe filling the air.  "The rarity is S-rank!" it added,  a testament to its incredible power. 
27.2.A.0.jpg;  "If the key's item class indicates the dungeon's difficulty, then my chances of survival diminish."  he muttered, a sense of dread creeping into his voice. "The best choice is to level up as much as I can and enter instant dungeons when I have the chance in the future."  he decided, a glimmer of determination in his eyes. "After B-rank, the difficulty of gates rises explosively." he reminded himself.  "Luckily,  the chance of higher-ranked gates opening drops with every level, so only a handful of S-rank gates have ever opened." he finished, a sigh escaping his lips. 
27.2.A.1.jpg; "One of them opened on Jeju Island." the caption stated,  a simple statement that held the weight of a world-changing event. The island, a once-peaceful paradise,  now held a dark secret.
27.3.A.0.jpg;  "After an S-rank dungeon gate broke there, it became a wasteland where humans cannot live anymore." the caption read,  a stark reminder of the devastating power of these gates. The once-lush island, now a barren wasteland,  stood as a silent monument to the price of power. 
27.3.A.1.jpg;  "Even if S-rank hunters created a team, it's unsure if they could clear an S-rank gate or not."  the inscription stated,  a chilling reminder of the formidable power of these creatures. The white lightning emanating from their mouths,  a symbol of their volatile energy,  added to their intimidating presence. 
27.5.A.jpg;  "With the current state of deployable hunters, clearing an S-rank gate is near impossible."  the inscription stated,  a stark reminder of the overwhelming challenge that lay ahead.  The dark silhouette,  a chilling reminder of the unknown,  stood as a symbol of the danger that lurked in the shadows. 
27.5.B.jpg; "Because of that, with my current level, I had to abstain from entering S-rank dungeons." the man stated.  The creatures,  their eyes burning with a primal hunger,  closed in on their prey. 
27.6.A.jpg;  "Toughness that cannot be penetrated." the inscription above the giant statue read, a chilling testament to its formidable power. "Strength that will result in instant death."  the inscription below the statue added,  a stark warning of the danger it posed. 
27.7.A.jpg;  "Ef of" the inscription whispered,  a cryptic message that hinted at the power unleashed. The explosion,  a blinding flash of energy,  ripped through the landscape, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. 
27.7.B.jpg;  "Above the hooded figure."  the inscription read,  a stark reminder of the danger he faced.  The beast,  its eyes glowing with a primal fury,  lunged forward,  its sharp teeth bared in a menacing grin. 
27.8.A.0.jpg;  "So I wondered if my attacks would work on those monsters on another level."  he mused,  a spark of curiosity igniting in his eyes.  The yellow glow emanating from his leg,  a testament to his power,  added to the excitement of the moment.
27.8.A.1.jpg;  The hooded figure stood,  his gaze fixed on the imposing creature,  his mind racing with thoughts and possibilities.  "It was simple curiosity."  he murmured,  a sense of wonder in his voice. 
27.9.A.jpg;  "Alarm -X."  a mechanical voice announced,  a warning of impending danger.  "-[Title: Wolf Slayer] buff effect is activating." it added,  a surge of adrenaline coursing through the air. 
27.9.B.jpg;  His eyes, glowing with an otherworldly light,  held a fierce determination.  The man stood poised,  his body radiating strength and confidence. 
27.10.A.0.jpg; "Skill: Sprint was activated, movement speed will increase by 30%, -1 mana will be consumed every minute." the notification announced,  a reminder of the power he wielded. The two monsters clashed,  their energy blades clashing in a flurry of chaos. 
27.10.A.1.jpg;  The monster roared,  its energy blades slashing through the air,  a whirlwind of chaos and destruction.  The white blur,  a fleeting glimpse of a powerful attack,  added to the sense of urgency. 
27.11.A.jpg;  The man launched himself forward,  his kick connecting with the monster's stomach with a resounding thud.  The monster recoiled,  its eyes wide with pain,  the blue energy blades swirling around it in a frenzy of chaos. 
27.11.B.jpg;  "Skill: Bloodlust was activated." the notification announced,  a surge of primal energy coursing through his veins. His eyes, blazing with power,  fixed on his target,  his body radiating a sense of untamed ferocity.
27.12.A.jpg;  The two monsters snarled at each other,  their teeth bared in a menacing display of aggression.  The tension in the air was palpable,  the air crackling with anticipation. 
27.12.B.jpg;  "The enemy's resistance was too high, the effect was cancelled." the notification announced,  a wave of disappointment washing over the monster. Its limbs trembled,  its body wracked with fear,  as it retreated into the shadows. 
27.13.A.0.jpg;  "It's not working." he muttered,  a wave of disappointment washing over him.  "It's a good matchup looking at my skills, but my attacks aren't having any effect." he lamented, a sense of frustration creeping into his voice. 
27.13.A.1.jpg; "To think that the difference is this big even with the title's buff." he exclaimed.  "[Title: Wolf Slayer] A title given to those proficient in hunting wolves. Your stats will increase by 40% when facing a beast-type monster." the notification read,  a reminder of the power he wielded. 
27.14.A.jpg; "There's no doubt, this dungeon is definitely S-rank." he declared. His blue eye,  glowing with a fierce determination,  fixed on the challenge ahead.
27.14.B.0.jpg;  "Hell's Gatekeeper Cerberus is using [Skill: Wrath]." the notification announced,  a warning of the impending danger. "Wrath will last for 3 minutes, Cerberus's stats will be doubled."  it added,  a chilling reminder of the beast's enhanced power.  
27.14.B.1.jpg;  The creature roared,  its multiple heads contorting in a terrifying display of fury. Its massive paw,  shrouded in flames,  slammed down,  a devastating force that threatened to crush everything in its path. 
27.16.A.0.jpg; The figure,  a blur of motion,  streaked through the air,  his body enveloped in flames,  a testament to his incredible speed and power. The intensity of the image,  the heat radiating from the figure,  filled the viewer with a sense of excitement. 
27.16.A.1.jpg; The female character stood poised, her sword held in a practiced grip,  her eyes locked on the monstrous figure.  The creature's menacing posture,  its teeth bared in a savage snarl,  created a palpable sense of tension. 
27.16.B.jpg; The man stood firm,  his sword held high,  his eyes focused on his opponent.  "The system tells me the gap between my enemies and I." he muttered,  a hint of determination in his voice.  The creature,  its eyes glowing with a primal fury,  lunged forward,  its teeth bared in a menacing grin.  
27.17.A.0.jpg;  "-[Cerberus did not feel any pain]." the notification read,  a stark reminder of the beast's resilience.  The creature,  its jaws agape,  its teeth gleaming with a sinister sheen,  stood as a testament to its immense power. 
27.17.A.1.jpg;  The man stood his ground,  his eyes locked on the creature,  a sense of unease creeping into his heart.  The creature's menacing presence,  its eyes burning with a primal hunger,  filled the air with an aura of danger.  
27.18.A.jpg; The man's right leg shot out, aiming a powerful kick at the monstrous figure. Caught off guard, the creature roared in anger as it braced itself for the impact. 
27.18.B.jpg;  Gripping the creature's arm, the man braced himself for the monster's retaliation. The creature's head lurched, its blood dripping down, a testament to the struggle.  
27.19.A.0.jpg; Blood splattered across his chest, the man felt a surge of pain as he staggered back. The battle was taking its toll, leaving him battered and bruised. 
27.19.A.1.jpg; A gaping crater marked the spot where the battle had raged, a testament to the immense power unleashed. Broken stones and charred earth surrounded the scar left by the impact.
27.19.B.jpg; The creature's blood dripped from above, painting the orange sky with a macabre hue. A hush fell over the scene as everyone watched, anticipation filling the air. 
27.21.A.jpg; Clutching his side, the man groaned in agony. The pain was intense, a reminder of the devastating blow he had just received. 
27.21.B.jpg; Despite the pain, the man's eyes hardened with resolve. He had activated his "Perseverance" skill, granting him a chance to survive this dire situation.
27.22.A.jpg; His eyes narrowed, the man focused his determination. This was no ordinary reawakening, a thought that fueled his will to push through the pain.
27.22.B.jpg; The beast roared, its voice echoing across the landscape. If he was chosen as someone's avatar, he would prove his worth by exceeding their expectations. 
27.23.A.jpg; A system message flashed before the man's eyes, offering a tempting reward. The words "Devour the System" glowed, promising power beyond imagination. 
27.23.B.jpg;  A blinding light erupted from the beast, illuminating the orange sky. This was no ordinary power, a force to be reckoned with. 
27.24.A.jpg; Trapped inside the beast's maw, the man struggled to break free. His arms flailed wildly, desperation fueling his every movement.
27.24.B.jpg; The man dodged a swift attack, his arms outstretched to maintain his balance. The swirling orange background blurred as he moved, the tension palpable in the air. 
27.25.A.0.jpg; Leaping forward with incredible speed, the man delivered a powerful kick to the beast's jaw. The beast roared in pain, its red eyes blazing with anger.
27.25.A.1.jpg;  The beast lunged forward, its sharp teeth bared in a terrifying display of power. Orange sparks flew as it ripped through the ground, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.
27.25.B.jpg; The beast let out a deafening roar, its horn glowing with a blinding light. The beam shot out, aimed at an unseen target, leaving a trail of destruction in its path.
27.27.A.0.jpg; The man's blue eye gleamed with determination, focused on his target. Every muscle in his body tensed, ready to unleash a devastating attack.
27.30.A.jpg; Two massive rocks stood tall, their rugged surfaces bearing witness to the harshness of the desert.  A veil of grey smoke hung in the air, a reminder of a recent battle. 
27.30.B.jpg; A broken rock formation lay in the center of the scene, its once-solid structure now shattered.  The remnants of the destruction stood as a stark reminder of the power unleashed here. 
27.31.A.jpg; Dust settled on the parched earth, creating a blanket of stillness. The desert landscape stretched out, a testament to the harshness of this unforgiving world. 
27.31.B.jpg;  The man stood tall, his fiery weapon held aloft,  a triumphant grin on his face.  The message above him proclaimed his victory, "You have slain Hell's Gatekeeper Cerberus." 
27.32.A.jpg;  The man stared at the beast, a mixture of concern and determination in his eyes.  "Thanks to you, I realised what my level is." the text above him read, revealing a truth he had not known before. 
27.32.B.jpg; The ornate gate loomed before the man, a symbol of his next challenge. "I will return once I have become a bit stronger." the text above it read, a promise of a future confrontation. 
27.34.A.jpg;  The city stretched out before the man, a labyrinth of tall buildings illuminated by the night's glow. A single plant peeked out from the door, a touch of life in this otherwise foreboding scene.
27.35.A.jpg;  The man's face was etched with lines, a testament to a life filled with hardship.  His eyes met the viewer's, their intensity conveying a sense of impending danger. 
27.35.B.jpg;  The man's eyebrows furrowed as he examined the message above his head. "What business' CEO did he say he was?" he wondered, his mind filled with suspicion. 
27.36.A.jpg;  "I heard that everything that happens in a dungeon stays in the dungeon." the man whispered. His companion remained silent, their shared understanding heavy in the air. 
27.36.B.jpg;  A sly smile played on the man's lips, radiating amusement and confidence. His eyes sparkled with a hint of mischief, a sign of a cunning mind at play. 
27.37.A.jpg;  The man's eyes narrowed as he reached for the bag. "What are you implying?" he asked. The contents of the bag held a secret he couldn't shake.
27.37.B.jpg;  The man stared at the message above his head, his jaw slack with shock. "Here's 2 billion." the words echoed in his mind, disbelief washing over him. 
27.37.C.jpg; "I think you can understand what I'm trying to say." the man stated.  His gaze remained fixed on the person he was addressing, his expression unwavering.
27.38.A.jpg;  Grasping the man's chest, the other man pleaded for his help. "Please, hunter, I beg you." he whispered. 
27.39.A.jpg;  Clutching his chest, the man's face twisted in agony. "Please...kill those bastards...!!" he screamed. 
27.39.B.jpg;  The man turned away, his shoulders slumping with resignation.  His footsteps echoed in the silence, a final farewell to the place that held his sorrow.
27.40.A.jpg;  "In addition to this money, 1 billion more to take care of the other hunters." the man said. "Is that possible for you?" the other man asked, a hint of urgency in his tone. 
27.40.B.jpg;  "It's no problem for me to kill those insects you mentioned." the man replied.  "But there are also other hunters in the dungeon along with those insects." he added, a chilling smile spreading across his face.
27.41.A.jpg;  "If you become a B-Rank hunter, you become separated as a high-class hunter, and receive some calls from major guilds." the man explained, pointing to the right.  "But do you know why I endured starvation and entered the monitoring department of the Hunter's Guild?" he asked, a hint of intrigue in his voice.
27.41.B.jpg;  The man smirked, his eyes glinting with arrogance. He pointed to the left, a mocking gesture that conveyed his utter confidence. 
27.42.A.jpg;  "For me, it's much more fun to kill people than monsters." the man said.  His words hung in the air, a chilling testament to his dark nature. 
27.42.B.jpg;  The title card for the manhwa shimmered, its mysterious aura beckoning the reader into a world of intrigue and danger. The Korean text promised an epic tale, its bold strokes hinting at the intensity that lay ahead. 
28.0.A.0.jpg; A foot slammed into the wooden floor, creating a resounding thud. The man in the kendo uniform roared, raising his sword high above his head. 
28.0.A.1.jpg;  The man sprinted forward, his kendo uniform a blur of motion against the bright yellow background. He moved with incredible speed, a blur of action.  
28.1.A.jpg;  The two kendo fighters stood locked in a tense duel, their swords poised for attack. The air crackled with anticipation, the intensity of their battle filling the room.  
28.1.B.jpg;  The instructor watched intently, his gaze fixed on the two kendo students. "Hap hap." he chanted.  
28.2.A.jpg;  The kendo helmet lay still, a testament to the intensity of the training session. The surrounding equipment echoed the quiet focus of the room.  "Hah hah."  a soft chuckle echoed in the air, a sign of the quiet satisfaction that came with hard work.
28.2.B.jpg;  "What are you saying? This old body will become useless if I don't train it properly." the orange-haired man growled, his face etched with determination.  "Master, you're as skilled as always." a voice spoke in admiration. 
28.3.A.jpg;  A confident smile spread across the man's face. "It's obvious you were going easy on me." he said, pride filling his voice.  
28.3.B.jpg;  The man's frustration grew. "Were you putting less strength in your thumb out of consideration for me? That wasn't even a handicap. If you still had both of your arms..." he muttered, his anger simmering.
28.5.A.jpg; "Stop...you're still talking about that even after it's been a few months." the man said, irritation evident in his voice. A ringing sound echoed through the room, a reminder of the constant calls he received.
28.5.B.jpg;  The man sighed, worry etched on his face. "Low rank hunters keep getting these kind of annoying calls." he muttered. "We'll have to stop here for today." he decided, putting the phone away. 
28.6.A.jpg;  "Master." a voice asked, a hint of concern in its tone. "Are you really planning on postponing your retirement?" 
28.6.B.jpg;  The man's eyes widened in surprise. "Retirement?" he echoed, disbelief evident in his voice.  
28.6.C.jpg;  The two men stood beside the window, their gazes fixed on the world outside.  "Even if I live, how long will I?" the man with brown hair pondered.  "With my remaining life, I want to stay useful to this world." the man with pink hair declared. 
28.8.A.0.jpg;  The man's eyebrows furrowed, a look of surprise crossing his face. "But this is really surprising." he muttered, a sense of disbelief in his voice.  "An S-Rank hunter being taught the way of the sword by a low rank like me." he added, his words laced with humility.
28.8.A.1.jpg;  The man clenched his fists, his determination unwavering. "Because even with a high rank, I can't make up for a lack of skill." he said.
28.10.A.jpg;  "A D-Rank dungeon this time?" the man with brown hair questioned, confusion evident in his voice. The blond man shrugged, his face a mask of disinterest.  The woman, however, beamed with excitement. 
28.10.B.0.jpg;  The man's face was etched with worry. "Since my awakening didn't affect my strength, my sword doesn't work on monsters." he explained.  "Why did a swordsman like me get awakened as a magic hunter?" he wondered, his gaze filled with confusion.  "The sword skills I've learnt over the past decades, I have no use for them in a dungeon..." he sighed, his words heavy with disappointment.
28.10.B.1.jpg;  The man's face hardened with determination. He had a new challenge to face, and he was ready to overcome it.
28.11.A.jpg;  The man walked away, his steps purposeful.  "There must be a reason for this." he said to himself.
28.11.B.jpg;  "Huh?" the man with red hair exclaimed, his eyes widening in surprise. He stared at the man in front of him, his confusion growing with each passing moment.  Pink petals danced through the air, a surreal backdrop to this unexpected encounter. 
28.12.A.jpg; The man's eyes widened in shock, his mouth agape. "Perhaps..." he stammered.  "Are you Mister Sung?!" he exclaimed. 
28.12.B.jpg;  The man's face was obscured by the hood, only his eyes visible.  "Mister Song Chi-yeol?" he questioned. 
28.13.A.0.jpg;  A wide smile spread across the man's face. "I didn't recognise you at all!" he exclaimed. "I can't find a trace of your old self!" he added, his eyes twinkling with curiosity. 
28.13.A.1.jpg;   The two men walked side by side, their steps echoing on the brick floor.  "You changed so much within a few months?!" the man exclaimed. "What happened to you?!" 
28.13.B.jpg;  The man's eyes widened in shock, his mouth open in surprise. "Ah!" he gasped. The woman beside him covered her mouth with her hands, her face hidden from view. 
28.15.A.jpg;   The man's face contorted in confusion, his brows furrowed in disbelief. "But, how..." he started.  "Did a torn leg..." he whispered, his words barely audible.
28.15.B.jpg;  The man smiled, a soft chuckle escaping his lips. "When I came to my senses it was fine, even I'm not sure what really happened." he explained, a hint of mystery in his voice.  "Great Spellcaster Kandiaru's Blessing: Temporary Effect Will to Rehabilitate: Any dismembered body parts are restored." the text below him read, explaining the miracle that had occurred.
28.16.A.jpg;  The man with red hair grinned, his face radiating relief.  "It's not good if a young man like you becomes disabled!" he exclaimed.  "What a relief! Such a relief!" he added, his words expressing his happiness. 
28.17.A.jpg;  The man with black hair smiled reassuringly. "Don't worry about this!" he said. "I'm lucky to have kept my life even with the few skills I have!" he added, a hint of gratitude in his voice.  "Even though I heard rumors that you were safe, I can't believe it even after seeing you with my own eyes!" the man with red hair exclaimed. 
28.17.B.jpg;   "You as well?!" the man with ginger hair exclaimed. "Are you also going because of the Guild's orders?" he questioned, his curiosity piqued.  "That's right." the man with black hair confirmed. 
28.18.A.jpg;  The man with ginger hair scanned the faces in front of him, his expression a mixture of concern and anticipation. "They're already here." he whispered. 
28.18.B.jpg;  A wide grin spread across the man's face, his eyes sparkling with excitement. "Haha... what a day this is." he exclaimed.  
28.19.A.jpg;   The three figures stood together, their silence heavy with unspoken emotions. "The members of that day are all here." a voice whispered, the words hanging in the air. 
28.19.B.jpg;  The woman's eyes widened in disbelief, her mouth gaping open in shock. "Jin-woo?!" she exclaimed. 
28.20.A.jpg;  The man's face hardened with determination, his gaze fixed on the horizon. "And..." he began.  "Ju-hee..." he continued. 
28.21.A.jpg;  The man's jaw tightened, his gaze unwavering.  "Mister Kim Sang-shik." he said. 
28.21.B.jpg;   "That day he ran away leaving us and Mister Sung behind." the man with ginger hair said. "He must not be happy to see us as he even pointed a sword at me to use me as a sacrifice." 
28.22.A.0.jpg;  The man's head hung low. "But even I left Sung in the end..." he said, his words laced with shame.  "I don't have any right to speak." he added.  The monstrous creature, its blue skin shimmering in the light, grinned menacingly.  "I see, I didn't think this through." it chuckled, its voice dripping with malice.  "Ku... my arm!!" it roared, its red eyes blazing with anger.  "We all..." it threatened, its voice echoing with power. 
28.22.A.1.jpg;  The group of people stood in awe, their eyes fixed on the monstrous ice creature. "Returned alive." a voice whispered, disbelief evident in its tone.  The creature, its blue glow pulsating, roared, its voice booming through the air.  "All of them just start moving!!" it commanded, its power palpable. 
28.24.A.jpg; Tears streamed down the woman's face. "Are you really Jin-woo?" she asked.  "You changed so much, I almost can't recognize you..." she whispered, her heart filled with a mixture of joy and sadness. 
28.24.B.jpg;  A wide smile spread across the man's face, his eyes gleaming with excitement.  "I'm a bit late." he said. 
28.25.A.jpg;  The woman's eyes widened in shock, her hand flying to her mouth to stifle a gasp.  "What, why..." she exclaimed.  "I looked for you as hard as I could... why now..." she whispered, her words filled with a mixture of relief and frustration.
28.25.B.jpg;  The man's brows furrowed, his face etched with concern. "Why did you grow so much?" he questioned.  "Your leg should be in a bad condition... huh?" the woman looked down at her leg, her eyes wide with disbelief.  "Your leg..." she whispered.
28.26.A.jpg;  The woman's eyes darted down to her leg, a worried expression crossing her face. "What happened to it?" she asked. 
28.27.A.jpg;  The man chuckled, his smile widening.  "That..." he began.  "What a romantic atmosphere." he finished, his eyes twinkling with mischief.
28.27.B.jpg;  The woman tilted her head, her eyes fixed on the men inside the van.  "Is somebody filming a drama here?" she wondered aloud.  
28.27.C.jpg;  The three men laughed, their eyes sparkling with amusement. The man in the middle made a strange face, his happiness radiating through his expression.  "Or do hunters date each other these days?" he asked, a playful glint in his eyes. 
28.28.A.jpg;   The two men, their orange jumpsuits a stark contrast against the backdrop of the city, walked forward with a determined stride. Their handcuffs clinked together with each step, a reminder of their shared fate.
28.28.B.jpg;   The man with purple hair glared at the man in orange.  "Shut up, you fools." he roared, his words sharp and cutting.  
28.29.A.jpg;  The man stood tall, his face a mask of determination, his gaze unwavering.  "This isn't a picnic." he said.  The pink sky shimmered above him, a backdrop to the impending danger. 
28.30.A.jpg;  The man's eyes narrowed. "What is this..." he growled, his tone laced with disbelief. The woman's jaw dropped in shock, her eyes wide with surprise. The man with red hair tilted his head, his expression a mixture of confusion and apprehension. 
28.30.B.jpg;  The woman pushed her glasses up her nose. "Sorry for being late. You two are the summoned hunters Sung Jin-woo and Song Chi-yeol?" she asked, her gaze fixed on the two men.  "We'll go through the procedure first." the man on the left said.  "W... wait, what's going on here?" the other man exclaimed, his confusion evident in his voice. 
28.31.A.jpg;  The woman's smile widened, her eyes gleaming with excitement.  "Oh, those people?" she said.  "They are rehabilitators that will join the raid with you hunters." she explained, gesturing towards the group of men in orange jumpsuits.
28.31.B.jpg;  The man with orange hair slammed his fist on the table, his anger palpable. "Rehabilitators?! Are you telling us to go raiding with criminals?!" he roared.  "E... even if they are criminals they were hunters in the past..." the man with black hair said, trying to reason with the other man. "And it's not rare for hunters who committed crimes to serve time in dungeons to reduce their sentence." he added. 
28.32.A.jpg;  The man with blonde hair buried his face in his hands, a wave of disappointment washing over him.  "My god..." he muttered.  "Please understand, hunters in this area have diminished significantly, so we have to resort to such measures." he said. 
28.32.B.jpg;  The man with purple hair smirked, his confidence radiating through his posture.  "Also, the Monitoring Department's Hunter Gang Tae-shik will participate in this raid, so don't worry." he said, a hint of arrogance in his voice.  "The rehabilitators are all C-Rank. Hunter Gang Tae-shik is B-Rank." he explained, his tone matter-of-fact.  "Approximately 10 C-Rank hunters are needed to beat an average B-Rank hunter." he added, his words a subtle reminder of the power imbalance.
28.33.A.jpg;  The man's face hardened with concern. "Something feels off." he said.  "Ju-hee, please drop out of this raid." he urged, his eyes pleading with her.  "What about you?" she asked. 
28.33.B.jpg;  The man's eyes glinted with determination, his jaw set in a firm line.  "I'm going." he declared. 
28.33.C.jpg;  The woman's eyes blazed with a fiery determination.  "Then I'm going too." she declared. a testament to her unwavering loyalty. 
28.34.A.jpg;  The woman's mouth hung open in shock, her eyes wide with disbelief.  The man's hand flew to his ear, his expression a mixture of worry and confusion.  "''" he whispered.  The tension in the air was thick, the weight of their anxieties pressing down on them. 
28.34.B.jpg; The man in the blue shirt walked ahead, his steps confident and sure. The other man, with the black and brown vest, kept a watchful eye over his shoulder, a silent trust flowing between them. 
28.36.A.jpg; The man with orange hair squinted, his brow furrowed with suspicion as he watched the figures in the distance. The woman with red hair and armor-like jacket walked ahead, her blue top catching the light as she strode confidently. 
28.36.B.jpg; The group of men, clad in various garments, stood together, their gazes fixed on the large blue expanse in the background. The woman with red hair, her head tilted up, whispered, "Are they really telling us to go raiding with these guys?"
28.38.A.0.jpg;  The woman in the black jacket leaped into the air, a surge of excitement coursing through her. Her brown hair flew behind her as she landed,  a sense of confidence radiating from her.
28.38.A.1.jpg; The man, clad in a black jacket, jumped with a burst of energy. His eyes were fixed on the ground as he landed, but a quiet confidence filled him.
28.39.A.jpg; "To the dungeon." the text read,  a sense of anticipation hanging in the air.  The title, written in a bold, elegant font, promised adventure and danger.
29.0.A.jpg; The metal object glinted in the light as he worked on the handcuffs, his movements precise and controlled. A sense of tension hung heavy in the air as he fought against the constraints. 
29.0.B.0.jpg;  The man stretched his arms behind his back, a sigh of relief escaping his lips.  His brown jacket stretched with him, a comfortable weight against his skin. 
29.0.B.1.jpg; The man's anger flared. "Shut it! Are you allowed to treat us like slaves? Huh?" 
29.1.A.jpg; The man with the badge that read "4924" smiled brightly at the man in the black suit, his happiness uncontainable. The man in the suit, holding a small metal object,  maintained a serious expression,  his gaze unreadable. 
29.1.B.jpg;  "I'm Gang Tae-Shik from the Monitoring Department." the man in the black suit announced, his expression serious. The man with blond hair looked surprised, while the man at the bottom of the picture appeared concerned.
29.1.C.jpg;  The man with blue hair, now radiating confidence, smiled and said, "You heard the explanation. I'll be keeping a close eye on them, so don't worry too much."  The man off-screen replied, "Who will lead the raid today?" 
29.3.A.jpg;  "Are you okay with me being the leader?" the man with the ponytail asked, his smile genuine. The man in the blue jacket agreed, saying, "Of course... then I'll leave it to you."
29.3.B.jpg;  The man in the blue jacket extended his hand towards the man with orange hair,  thanking him for the opportunity. The man with orange hair, surprised by the gesture, stammered, "Mister? Thank you for giving me another chance."
29.3.C.jpg;  The man with brown hair, standing in the middle of the city street, looked thoughtful,  his mind racing. "If it was my fault that 11 people died." he murmured, "then it was thanks to you that 6 people survived."
29.4.A.jpg;  His gaze downcast, the man in the black suit explained, "My responsibility was the greatest when it came to not being able to protect everyone. When I bow, I'm thanking you in place of all the hunters." 
29.4.B.jpg;  A sense of gratitude washed over the man with orange hair, as he looked down and said,  "Sung, thank you."
29.4.C.jpg;  "Mister, raise your head." the man with the bandana commanded, his expression stern and serious. The man in blue shirt and armor looked up reluctantly. 
29.6.A.jpg;  The man with orange hair, his face a mask of stress, spoke in a strained voice. "Even if I lead this raid..." 
29.6.B.jpg;  The man with black hair, his back to the viewer, muttered, "Do whatever you like." his voice laced with annoyance. 
29.7.A.jpg;  The man's face hardened, his eyes narrowed in suspicion. His gaze scanned the surroundings,  searching for any sign of danger.
29.7.B.jpg;  The green goblin, its armor glinting in the sunlight, charged forward, its glowing red eyes filled with fury. "Kiyee!" it roared, its sharp teeth bared. 
29.9.A.0.jpg;  The green goblin, a blur of green and blue,  rushed forward with incredible speed, its lower half visible against the bright blue sky.
29.9.A.1.jpg;  The green goblin, its sharp teeth bared in a fearsome roar, leaped into the air,  its blue sword glinting behind it.
29.9.B.jpg;  The man, his black mask concealing his features, stood tall and imposing. He raised the long metal object, its blue glow illuminating the fallen goblin. "Do they want to get beaten up?" he asked.
29.10.A.0.jpg;  The man, his brown jacket flapping in the wind, swung the glowing metal object with a vicious arc, sending the green goblin flying through the air.  "How bland!" he scoffed.
29.10.A.1.jpg;  The man, his confidence radiating,  watched as the green goblin soared through the air,  his power evident in his stance.  "Try coming at us in packs!" he challenged.
29.10.B.jpg;  The man, his face contorted with annoyance,  exhaled a frustrated sigh.  "Hmph!" he muttered, his gaze fixed on the battle unfolding before him. 
29.11.A.jpg;  The man in the prison uniform, his right hand clenched into a fist,  lunged forward with a menacing smile. His white bandages, a testament to past battles,  added an air of danger to his fighting stance.
29.12.A.0.jpg;  The green goblin screamed as it was sent soaring through the air,  a powerful kick connecting with its body. The person, their red shirt and brown pants blurring in the motion,  exuded raw power.
29.12.A.1.jpg;  The man,  his brown pants and shirt blending with the earth,  launched a powerful kick,  his right leg extended in a fluid motion.  His determination fueled his every movement,  a sense of action and energy pulsing through the air.
29.12.B.jpg;  The man's brow furrowed as he looked at the dark figure, his eyes filled with confusion.  "I can't see who's the monster and who's the human." he whispered, a sense of fear and uncertainty gripping him.
29.13.A.jpg;  The man,  his brown jacket pulled tight against the cold,  stood ready to fight.  His gaze was fixed on the green figure, his hair tied back,  his expression determined.  "Kike!" he hissed,  a challenge ringing in the air.
29.13.B.0.jpg;  The hand, ablaze with orange light,  shot a powerful blast of fire,  leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. 
29.13.B.1.jpg;  The man, his brown jacket billowing behind him,  extended his arm,  his hand glowing with an intense orange light.  He unleashed a wave of fire, his power evident in the surge of energy that erupted from his hand. 
29.15.A.jpg;  The person,  their hand glowing orange,  created a swirling vortex of fire,  deflecting the goblins' attacks.  "Kiki."  they muttered, their voice barely audible over the roar of the flames. 
29.15.B.jpg;  The man's eyes, glowing with a fierce yellow light,  focused on the battle before him.  His hand, ablaze with orange energy,  released a wave of fire,  his power and determination undeniable.
29.15.C.jpg;  The person,  their hand ablaze with orange light,  launched a stream of fire,  its trajectory a deadly arc.  "Kike." they yelled,  the force of their attack evident in the sparks that flew from their hand.  "Kieeee!!"  they roared, their power unleashed.
29.16.A.jpg;  The man with short brown hair, his face etched with concern, spoke to his companion. "Song Chi-Yeol, that man... I don't think he's a normal C-Rank..."  A sense of curiosity and unease filled the air.
29.16.B.jpg;  The man with short brown hair, his gaze fixed on the man with blonde hair,  challenged, "Kim, is it fine if a swordsman's swing is weak like that?" The man with blonde hair scoffed, his arrogance dripping from his words. "Hmph! It seems you like to act the leader as always." 
29.17.A.jpg;  The blonde man,  his hand raised in a gesture of reassurance,  said, "Let's be positive."  A wave of relief washed over the group as they realized all the survivors from the incident were now reunited.
29.17.B.jpg;  The man with orange hair,  his brow furrowed with concern,  commented,  "It seems Sung has improved a lot."  The woman with brown hair, her expression unreadable, simply replied, "Is that so?"
29.18.A.jpg;  The woman,  her smile playful,  asked, "Sure you didn't train in martial arts while you were gone?"  The man with short black hair,  his smile genuine,  replied, "I just do some exercise every day." 
29.18.B.jpg;  The blonde man,  his expression a mix of shock and surprise,  said,  "I said it as a joke, but it looks like he's changed a lot."  He continued,  "You're different from the Jin-Woo I used to know."
29.19.A.jpg;  The man,  his smile unwavering,  said,  "Not only his appearance, but his aura too..."  A sense of pride filled the air as the others acknowledged his transformation. "Is he really the Sung I knew?" one of them wondered.
29.19.B.jpg;  The woman,  her back to the viewer,  stood rigid,  her hands clenched tightly.  "On the other hand, Ju-Hee seems afraid."  someone noted.  "To be afraid of mere goblins, her trauma must be deep."
29.20.A.jpg;  The group stood before the cave entrance,  their eyes drawn to the three paths leading deeper into the darkness.  "It's unfortunate, but at this rate she'll have to retire." one of them lamented.  "Darn, the path branches into three." another exclaimed.
29.20.B.jpg;  The man with purple hair,  his back to the viewer,  suggested,  "Since the difficulty is relatively low, how about we split up?"  The woman with brown hair agreed,  "Although the danger might increase, the clear time will significantly decrease." 
29.21.A.jpg;  The two men,  their expressions serious,  stood in the dimly lit cave,  the blue shapes around them casting strange shadows.  "Let's split up." the man with purple hair suggested. "I'll bring the criminals to the right-most path, so if you perchance find the boss room, you can come tell us quickly."
29.21.B.jpg;  The man's eye,  glowing an eerie blue,  stared up at the darkness,  a connection evident between his gaze and the pulsating blue light emanating from the cave.  The darkness held a sense of mystery and power,  drawing the eye deeper into the unknown.
29.22.A.jpg;  "Mister Song Chi-Yeol, let's go to the left path." the man with brown hair suggested. The man with black hair nodded, replying, "Sure." The two men, their expressions focused,  navigated the dimly lit path,  ready for whatever challenges lay ahead.
29.22.B.jpg; The man with purple hair, his profile illuminated by the faint blue light,  stared intently to the right,  his expression unreadable.  His focus was unwavering,  a sense of anticipation building within him.
29.22.C.jpg;  The man with black hair,  his grey jacket blending with the shadows,  looked to the right,  his expression a mixture of confusion and uncertainty.  A question mark hovered above his head, reflecting the puzzle that had just presented itself.
29.24.A.jpg;  The man with black hair,  his gaze fixed on the right tunnel,  paused in thought,  a small thought bubble above his head containing three dots.  "The boss is at the end of this path."  a voice whispered,  adding to the air of anticipation.
29.24.B.jpg;  The man,  his hand gripping the large black blade,  considered his options.  "Since goblins don't give me much experience,  I'll have to at least kill the boss to obtain some more."  he thought.  "But more than that..."  A sense of determination fueled his every action.
29.25.A.jpg;  The man with blue hair,  his expression grim,  stood in the dark room,  the skulls on the wall a stark reminder of the danger that surrounded him.  "He's worrying me."  he whispered,  his gaze fixed on the man behind him.
29.26.A.jpg;  "Did you take care of them?" the man in the black suit asked.  The man with brown hair  smirked,  "This is a piece of cake."  The man with black hair,  his confidence radiating,  added,  "They're weak.  Mere goblins don't even stand a chance against me."
29.27.A.0.jpg;  The goblins,  small and seemingly insignificant,  lurked in the shadows.  "Goblins usually have lower strength and health than a grown man,  and their size and intelligence are those of a child's,  but they are annoying foes who use sneak attacks and swarm their targets."  the text warned.
29.27.A.1.jpg;  The goblins,  their malicious grins stretched wide,  stared out with their large red eyes.  "Of course, even if you give a weapon to a human child,  they will be just as annoying."  the text stated,  a chilling reminder of their potential danger.
29.27.B.jpg;  The man in the black suit,  his expression cold and calculating,  stood over the fallen creature.  "Because even a child can kill a person with a weapon."  the text explained.  The fallen creature,  its large mouth agape,  lay bleeding on the ground.  "In reality,  countless child soldiers are armed and attack people on the other side of the earth."  the text revealed,  a horrifying truth. 
29.28.A.jpg;  The man with purple hair,  his face contorted with rage,  spat out his words with venom.  "There's no difference between humans and monsters."  he snarled.  "They're both insects."
29.28.B.jpg;  "Can you guys kill children?"  a voice asked,  its tone laced with boredom.  The man with purple hair,  his expression apathetic,  replied,  "What boring question are you asking us?"
29.29.A.jpg;  The man with purple hair,  his black suit a stark contrast against the backdrop,  shook his head,  a wave of disinterest washing over him.  "That's right."  he mumbled.  "It's a boring question."
29.29.B.jpg;  The man with brown hair,  his face flushed with anger,  stared at the man with purple hair.  "You will meet a hundred children in this dungeon from now on."  the man in the black suit announced.  "What are you saying? Why are there children in a dungeon?"  the man with brown hair demanded.
29.30.A.jpg;  The shadowy figures,  their red eyes glowing in the darkness,  grinned menacingly.  "The children are starved,  so they will eat all your flesh."  the text read.  "Can you kill those things?"  another voice asked,  a tremor of fear evident in its tone.
29.30.B.jpg;  The three men,  their smiles wicked,  exuded an air of confidence and malice.  "Of course."  one of them chuckled.  "Kill them." another urged.  "We can kill them."  they all agreed, their words dripping with menace. 
29.31.A.0.jpg;  The emptiness of the picture,  broken only by the words "I'll have to report it like this to the Hunter's Guild" and "You guys."  created a sense of suspicion and anxiety. 
29.31.A.1.jpg;  The red background,  dotted with white specks,  created a sense of suspense and uncertainty,  the word "Here" echoing in the silence. 
29.33.A.0.jpg;  The man's single blue eye,  glowing intensely,  radiated anger and power.  The red circles surrounding his face heightened the sense of tension,  as if a storm was brewing within him. 
29.33.A.1.jpg;  The man,  his smile cruel and predatory,  exuded an air of power and excitement.  "Met a hundred goblins."  he boasted,  his words dripping with satisfaction. 
29.34.A.jpg; The goblin, its single eye burning with ferocity,  lunged at its fellow,  its teeth bared in a menacing grin.  Blood splattered as it squeezed the life out of the unfortunate victim,  a scene of brutal dominance.
29.34.B.jpg;  "If a goblin is this easy,  it's doable."  the man in the blue jacket said,  a hint of worry in his voice.  The man in the brown vest smiled confidently,  "It would be good if the raid ended with nothing major happening."
29.35.A.jpg; "I don't think anything will happen."  the man with brown hair said,  his expression thoughtful.  The woman with black hair,  her eyes wide with surprise,  replied,  "So that means our profits will go down."
29.36.A.jpg;  "I've decided." the man in the blue jacket mumbled.  "After this raid, I'll also bow to Sung and apologize."  he said,  his gaze cast down in shame.
29.36.B.jpg;  "Don't you also feel guilty? We both ran away. Us, who are called hunters." the man with brown hair said.  He looked down,  his face hidden behind his hand,  a deep sense of shame washing over him.
29.37.A.0.jpg;  The man with the purple jacket,  his expression serious,  considered his actions.  "We can't just act normally after leaving a teammate behind."  he thought.  "If we're going to continue being hunters,  we have to get used to something as small as bowing our heads.  Although I don't know if he'll forgive us."
29.37.A.1.jpg;  The man with the purple jacket, his hand clutching his sword,  made a decision.  "No, even if there's no way he'll forgive us,  I will apologize."  he said,  a sense of responsibility driving his words.
29.37.B.jpg;  The man with the brown bandana,  his expression resolute,  spoke with urgency.  "We have no time,  let's go." 
29.39.A.jpg;  The two men stood at the entrance of the cave,  their gazes fixed on the darkness within.  "Hm?"  one of them mumbled,  a sense of worry creeping into his voice.  "Maybe the others already finished up and left?" he suggested.  "Y... yes!"  the other man agreed. 
29.39.B.jpg; The man, his eyes wide with terror,  stood in the dark cave,  his face pale with fear.  Something had startled him,  something lurking in the shadows,  something unknown. 
29.39.C.jpg; The man,  his eyes wide with shock,  gasped,  "W..."  The terror etched on his face was undeniable,  a silent scream caught in his throat.
29.40.A.jpg;  The person,  their dark jacket blending with the shadows,  stared in disbelief.  "What?!"  the words echoed in the air,  a sense of disbelief and shock hanging heavy. 
30.0.A.jpg;  The simple,  yet powerful,  words "But what can I do?"  painted a picture of helplessness,  a feeling of being trapped in a hopeless situation.
30.1.A.jpg;  The man with purple hair,  his smile sinister and cruel,  said,  "They're telling me to kill you quickly."  The man with black hair,  his face pale with fear,  pleaded,  "Pl... please don't kill me..."
30.2.A.jpg;  The two men,  their gazes fixed on the cave entrance,  exchanged a glance.  "The ones who went in the other direction didn't finish yet, right?"  one of them asked.  "Huh?"  the other replied,  a sense of curiosity bubbling within him.
30.2.B.jpg;  The man,  his face contorted with fear,  stood in the cavern,  his eyes wide with terror.  Something had startled him,  something lurking in the darkness,  something he couldn't comprehend.
30.3.A.0.jpg;  The man,  his face a mask of shock,  stared in disbelief.  "Th..."  he stammered.  "This..."  He couldn't believe his eyes,  the sight before him a horrifying spectacle.
30.3.A.1.jpg;  The man in the blue jacket,  his gaze fixed on the dead man in the orange jumpsuit,  stood in the pool of blood,  a sense of horror pervading the air.  The other two men,  their faces hardened,  looked towards the man hanging in the air,  the scene a brutal testament to the violence that had unfolded.
30.4.A.jpg; The man with purple hair,  his smirk widening,  asked,  "Why are you two appearing from there?"  His voice, laced with suspicion,  echoed through the cavern.  "What?"  he added,  his eyes narrowed.
30.5.A.jpg;  The man in the black suit,  his sword still dripping with blood,  stared at the viewer,  a look of surprise on his face.  "That means the way to the boss room is to the left."  he realized,  a sense of relief washing over him.  "Now I don't have to roam around aimlessly." 
30.5.B.jpg; The two men,  their faces a mixture of shock and surprise,  looked at the viewer.  "My schedule's changed a little..."  the text above them announced,  a sense of unease hanging in the air. 
30.6.A.jpg;  The man, his blue jacket a stark contrast against the dark blue walls,  stared to the left,  his expression a mixture of worry and apprehension.  "Aaaa aahh hh."  the text to his right echoed,  a sense of impending doom settling over the scene.
30.6.B.jpg;  The two men,  their faces etched with fear,  looked at the viewer,  their eyes wide with alarm.  "Mr. Song Chi-Yeol, let's go back!"  the text above them read,  a sense of urgency driving their words.  "Yeah, let's go!"  they agreed, their voices laced with fear. 
30.7.A.jpg;  The woman with red hair,  her face pale with fear,  ran through the dark cave,  her brown jacket flapping behind her.  The man in the orange jacket followed close behind,  his eyes darting around in search of danger.  The man in the blue jacket,  his expression grim,  ran towards them,  a sense of urgency propelling him forward.
30.7.B.jpg;  The three characters,  their expressions a mixture of determination,  fear,  and anger,  ran forward,  a sense of danger pushing them onward.  The man with black hair,  his focus unwavering,  led the way,  his blue jacket a beacon of hope in the darkness. 
30.7.C.jpg;  The darkness of the cave,  broken only by the blur of motion,  suggested a frantic escape,  a desperate flight for survival.  The sense of speed and urgency was palpable,  a testament to the danger lurking in the shadows. 
30.9.A.0.jpg;  The man with blue hair,  his knife glinting in the dim light,  lunged at the man with black hair,  his expression vicious.  The woman,  her eyes wide with fear,  watched as the man with black hair blocked the attack,  the tension in the air thick with danger.
30.9.A.1.jpg;  The man,  his blue jacket billowing behind him,  moved with incredible speed,  his determined gaze fixed on the horizon.  "Ol."  the text whispered,  a testament to his raw power and relentless pursuit. 
30.9.B.jpg;  The man with blue hair,  his smile smug and arrogant,  watched with amusement.  "Hoh, pretty fast,  huh?"  he scoffed,  his words dripping with confidence.
30.10.A.jpg;  The man,  his face a mixture of confusion and shock,  stared in disbelief.  "What are you doing?"  the text above him questioned,  a sense of bewilderment hanging in the air. 
30.10.B.jpg; One hand reached out, its fingers gripping the other hand tightly. The sword was gripped firmly, the air charged with tension. 
30.11.A.jpg; The man, cloaked in shadows, soared through the air, his blade glinting in the dim light of the cave. Below, the three figures watched in stunned silence, their faces etched with disbelief.
30.11.B.jpg;  He blocked my ambush? The purple-haired man's eyes widened in astonishment.  You actually stopped that? His voice was laced with disbelief. Your senses are pretty sharp. 
30.12.A.jpg; Even if my orders were not to get into fights with others, it looked like that b-rank healer was going to be a nuisance, so I tried to remove her first, but...  I guess I'll have to change the plan. W... what is this?  Suddenly... 
30.12.B.jpg; His voice crackled with fury.  I'm going to kill you all. 
30.13.A.jpg; The blue-haired man stood over the bodies, his sword dripping with blood.  Just like them.
30.13.B.jpg;  W-wait!  The man's voice was a choked whisper.  Why is a guild member doing this?! 
30.15.A.0.jpg;  His eyes were wide with worry. Dear, he whispered. Yes? His voice trembled slightly. Your hunter job... can't you quit it? 
30.15.A.1.jpg; It's too dangerous. But what else can we do in this era of national depression?  Haven't you thought about those waiting for someone who might never return? Again with this?  
30.15.B.jpg;  Still better than earning meager amounts in some construction site. The hunter's guild won't order us low-tiers to raid high-leveled dungeons. Alright. Considering how our first... 
30.16.A.jpg; Alright, I love you, Dad.  Hmm?  Why are you a hunter? Haha, our second child is asking random questions now? 
30.16.B.jpg; The other kids are all fascinated about how my dad's a hunter.  Dad, does that mean you're stronger than all the other dads? 
30.18.A.jpg; Yeah, Daddy's strong.  Only 1 out of 1000 people were awakened. Of those, 1 out of 5000 were D-rank or higher.  Many lives rest on our shoulders... 
30.20.A.0.jpg; And not tomorrow...  I can't... 
30.20.A.1.jpg;  I can't die. 
30.21.A.0.jpg; The red bled into the black, a disturbing contrast.  He was lying there, his legs bent at an unnatural angle.
30.21.A.1.jpg;  The blood soaked into the fabric of his clothes, a stark reminder of the violence that had transpired.  The sword lay beside him, its gleaming surface reflecting the red of the blood. 
30.21.B.jpg;  Mr. Kim Sang-shik...?  He blinked, his mind struggling to comprehend the situation. 
30.23.A.jpg;  He clutched his chest, his breaths shallow and ragged. The blood stained his shirt, a stark reminder of the battle he had just endured. 
30.23.B.0.jpg;  Hurry up and heal him!!  He looked at the woman, his eyes filled with worry.  She stared back at him, her face a mixture of surprise and concern. 
30.23.B.1.jpg;  O... okay!!  Her voice was strained, her eyes darting away from him.  He clenched his fists, his frustration simmering beneath the surface. 
30.24.A.jpg;  Kuk!  He gasped, his body wracked with pain.  She gently pressed her hand against his chest, her fingers tracing the outline of the wound. 
30.24.B.jpg; No... you...  Her voice trembled with fear.  Can't...  He whispered, his eyes filled with despair.  Save me anyways... 
30.25.A.jpg; You...  He strained to speak.  Can stop...  I...  His eyes pleaded for an answer, a glimmer of hope. 
30.25.B.jpg; Lost...  He slumped against her, his body weak and spent.  Too much blood.  Her voice choked with despair, her arms wrapped tightly around him.
30.26.A.jpg;  You have to live.  He barked.  You said you had to live for your family! 
30.26.B.jpg; So that...  His lips curled into a cruel smile.  I can hate you...  I'm sorry...  Live no matter what... 
30.28.A.jpg;  I wanted to apologize with my head down...  He slumped against the wall, his shoulders slumped with defeat. I... didn't want to apologize like this. 
30.28.B.jpg; If I...  He grimaced, blood staining his cheek.  Put my head down now...  I'd...  Die.  
30.29.A.jpg;  Kuk!  His breath hitched, a painful gasp escaping his lips.  Huk!  His body convulsed, the pain etched into every line of his face. 
30.30.A.0.jpg; Mr. Sung... I'm sorry.  He looked down. 
30.30.A.1.jpg;  Really sorry... His voice was a pained whisper, blood staining his chin.  
30.31.A.jpg;  He stared upwards, his eyes wide with shock. 
30.31.B.jpg; The blood pooled around him, a crimson stain on the cold, hard ground.  His body lay still, the life drained from his eyes.
30.33.A.jpg;  Why did you do that to Mr. Kim Sang-shik?  He questioned.
30.33.B.jpg; Dunno.   The man with purple hair shrugged.  Could've been monsters. 
30.33.C.jpg;  One day, a gate opened and monsters overran the hunters.  He grinned, his eyes glinting with a sinister light.  It's like a natural catastrophe. 
30.34.A.jpg;  I thought of a good story just now.  He smirked, his eyes sparkling with mischief.  It used to be a massacre story with the goblins, but I guess I should change it up a little. 
30.35.A.0.jpg; The criminals broke free and tried to escape. After killing all of you, they tried to attack me, who was busy fighting the boss.  But it was too much for them to kill the B-rank hunter, Kang Tae-shik.  And therefore I was the only one who survived the raid.  
30.35.A.1.jpg; How about it?  The people outside would believe this story, right?  He looked down at the man. 
30.36.A.jpg; Of shit...  He muttered, his face grim.  No. He's not someone you can beat. 
30.36.B.jpg; I will do it.  He gritted his teeth, his eyes burning with determination.  He's a B-rank... there's no way he would be hit by a C-rank like me. 
30.36.C.jpg;  Plus he's an assassin type. I can't beat him at speed...  Mr. Kim, I'm borrowing this for a while. 
30.37.A.jpg;  But he probably has a weak defense... Who knows what'll happen if I'm able to hit him once with magic.  It's been a while since I raised a sword against a human. 
30.38.A.jpg; Miss Ju-hee is here too...  She gasped, her eyes widening in surprise. Miss Ju-hee, can you give me a physical strength buff? 
30.38.B.jpg; Huh? Y-yes!  Her voice was shaky, her hands glowing with a bright yellow light.  Mr. Song with a sword...?
30.39.A.jpg;  Let's close the range so that he can't dodge!  He charged forward, his arm outstretched, his eyes fixed on his target.
30.39.B.jpg;  He frowned. 
30.40.A.jpg;  What's a magician like you doing?  He smirked, his eyes gleaming with amusement. 
30.40.B.jpg;  Physical strength buffs on a magician are pretty useless, but...  He pondered, his body glowing with a faint yellow light. 
30.40.C.jpg; For now.  The sword hummed with power, its orange glow pulsing with energy. 
30.42.A.0.jpg; Let's do this!!  His eyes blazed with determination, his body radiating with a bright yellow light.
30.42.A.1.jpg;  The ground cracked beneath his feet, the orange dust swirling around him.  His legs were steady, his stance strong and unwavering.
30.43.A.jpg; I'm a swordsman.  The green dots danced in the background, a mystery waiting to be unraveled. 
31.0.A.jpg; Physical strength buffs on a magician are pretty useless, but...  He pondered, his body glowing with a faint yellow light. 
31.0.C.jpg;  He stood tall, his grip firm on the silver blade.  The light enveloped him, a beacon of unwavering resolve. 
31.2.A.0.jpg; Since I'm a magician, I need to be aware of the strength, stamina, and agility differences between him and me. He thought, his brow furrowed with concentration. 
31.2.A.1.jpg;  He was ready to face the threat head-on, his sword gleaming in the yellow light. 
31.2.B.jpg; Even if I'm being protected by Miss Ju-hee, it's like installing a car engine on a bike and pedalling as hard as I could.  Her voice was filled with determination, her eyes fixed on the approaching danger. 
31.3.A.jpg; It's like a steep downhill...  He gripped the handlebars, his eyes focused on the road ahead. If I don't control my speed and take a huge curve, I will probably die.  
31.3.B.jpg;  He lunged forward, his fist aimed at her face.  She gasped, her eyes widening in fear as she instinctively raised her arms to shield herself. 
31.3.C.jpg;  Their swords clashed, sparks flying in the air.  They stood locked in a tense standoff, their eyes burning with anger and determination. 
31.4.A.jpg;  It's normal for a magician to be in a disadvantage against an assassin.  He smirked, a sly glint in his eyes. It might've been a good idea to bring out a weapon.
31.4.B.jpg;  But in the end, you're just a magician.  He snarled. 
31.5.A.jpg;  If your physical level couldn't even reach D-rank, would holding a weapon even make a difference?  He looked at the other man, his face etched with confusion. 
31.5.B.jpg;  His eyes widened in surprise, a surge of adrenaline coursing through him.  He swung his sword, his movements swift and precise. 
31.6.A.jpg;  He swung his sword with power and precision, the blade shining brightly in the air.  His determination was unwavering, his focus unwavering.
31.7.A.jpg; It certainly does.  He gritted his teeth, his anger burning in his single visible eye. 
31.7.B.jpg; Your movements are good!  He nodded, impressed by the other man's skill. Although you were buffed, I feel a lot of practice in those movements. 
31.7.C.jpg; It was only for a moment, but he caught up with him.  His eyes were fixed on the other man, his expression calm and focused. 
31.8.A.jpg;  If I can go just a little faster...  He pushed himself harder, his brow furrowed with desperation. 
31.8.B.jpg;  He stood his ground, his body tense with anticipation.  His eyes were locked on his opponent, his determination unwavering. 
31.9.A.jpg;  Fast and precise  pretty cool! It really was a good idea to abandon magic and hold a weapon.  He chuckled, a smirk playing on his lips. 
31.9.B.jpg; But that's just it.  He grinned, his eyes glinting with confidence. 
31.10.A.jpg;  The feeling is a pain.  He closed his eyes, a wave of exhaustion washing over him.  The other man stood before him, his face etched with determination. 
31.10.B.jpg;  He grimaced, his eyes squeezed shut.  The feeling was a pain.  
31.11.A.jpg; I can't let this become an endurance battle. I'll eliminate you as fast as I can.  She tightened her grip on her weapon, her eyes burning with determination.  
31.11.B.jpg; How dare you show your back to a swordsman?  He charged forward. You look down on me too much.   
31.12.A.jpg;  He blocked the blow, his sword meeting the other man's with a clang.  His eyes narrowed, his face set in a determined mask. 
31.12.B.jpg;  Looks like you're not just a regular old man.  He smirked, his eyes gleaming with confidence.  
31.13.A.jpg;  I may not look like it, but I have an S-rank student.   His voice was steady, his expression a mix of seriousness and confidence.
31.13.B.jpg;  Even if my body can't keep up, my skills will.  He charged forward, his sword flashing in the air. 
31.13.C.jpg; Unfortunately, there's always limits to one's given strength.  His brow furrowed with concern. 
31.14.A.jpg;  His eyes widened in shock, his jaw slack with disbelief. 
31.14.B.jpg;  Did you honestly think that a magician can follow an assassin's speed? Such naivety.  He grinned, his confidence overflowing.
31.15.A.jpg;  The beams of energy crackled around him, a testament to his immense power.  He stood poised, a dangerous predator ready to strike. 
31.15.B.jpg;  He gasped, his chest heaving with pain.  The blood stained his clothes, a stark reminder of the brutal battle. 
31.16.A.jpg; If it was someone else, then you might've won.  He scoffed.  But my rank itself is superior to yours. 
31.16.B.jpg;  A magician probably can't even see my movements.  He closed his right eye, his expression confident and assured. 
31.16.C.jpg;  Mr. Song!!  She cried out.  Her eyes widened with fear as she saw the blood staining his jacket. 
31.18.A.jpg;  She gasped, her eyes widening in horror.  His hand hung limply by his side, the blood staining his jacket a gruesome red. 
31.18.B.jpg;  Yeah, that's right. It seems like you finally realize it's all futile.  He chuckled, his purple eyes glowing with a sinister light. 
31.19.A.jpg;  I'll kill you painlessly in return.  He smirked. 
31.20.A.jpg;  The energy crackled around his hand, a surge of power building within him. 
31.20.B.jpg;  The explosion roared, a blinding white light engulfing them both.  The force of the blast sent debris flying through the air.
31.20.C.jpg;  The flames danced and roared, their power awe-inspiring.  He stared in wonder, his mouth agape. 
31.21.A.jpg;  Did it work...?  He looked around, his eyes searching for confirmation. 
31.21.B.jpg;  A magician like you acting like a swordsman to hide his magical skills.  He laughed.  The man with orange hair clenched his fists, his anger simmering beneath the surface. 
31.22.A.jpg;  To unleash your magical power as soon as a sword is hurtling towards you.  His eyes gleamed with a sly, predatory light.  Not a bad plan at all... you sly old fox. 
31.22.B.jpg;  The man with orange hair looked forward, his face etched with a mix of annoyance and confusion. "Of course... is this it...?" he murmured, struggling to comprehend the situation. 
31.23.A.jpg;  The man with purple hair stood firm, his black suit and blue sword a stark contrast to the anger radiating from him. "Die."  he growled, his eyes burning with a dangerous intensity.
31.23.B.jpg;  The blue sword, a blur of white energy, slashed through the air, its trajectory aimed with deadly precision.  The anticipation hung heavy, the air charged with the promise of imminent destruction. 
31.24.A.0.jpg;  The man with black hair stood tall, his blue jacket a splash of color against the backdrop of determination. He radiated an aura of power and readiness, his eyes fixed on the coming battle. 
31.24.A.1.jpg;  The man with black hair held the other man down, his foot firmly planted on his opponent's chest.  The orange-haired man,  caught off guard, struggled against the relentless pressure, his face twisted in shock.
31.24.B.jpg;  The man with purple hair, his blue sword clutched in his trembling hand, stumbled back in surprise.  He had a black eye and looked terrified,  pain twisting his features as he tried to process what had just happened.
31.25.A.jpg;  The woman with orange hair, her face a mask of fear, stared wide-eyed at something unseen. Her body tensed,  as if caught in the grip of a terrifying realization.
31.25.B.jpg;  "You again." the purple-haired man snarled, his frustration evident in the way his jaw clenched.  He was annoyed by the return of someone he clearly knew.
31.25.C.jpg;  "Who are you?" the man with purple hair demanded, his eyes narrowing as he surveyed the mysterious figure.  His confusion was palpable,  his brow furrowed in an attempt to decipher the identity of the stranger.
31.27.A.0.jpg;  "What's your rank?" the man with black hair asked, his gaze unwavering as he introduced himself.  "Sung Jin-Woo." he declared. 
31.27.A.1.jpg;  The man walked along the rocky terrain, his blue jeans and black shoes blending into the blue background.  "E-rank." he muttered, his disappointment heavy in the air.
31.28.A.jpg;  The man with purple hair stood poised, his two knives glinting in the blue light. His confident expression betrayed his readiness to fight, his eyes focused on the two men in the distance.
31.28.B.jpg;  "An E-rank?" the man with purple hair exclaimed, his surprise evident in his wide eyes.  "Heh... that can't be." he muttered, disbelief hanging in the air.
31.28.C.jpg;  The glowing sword, a dangerous blue energy radiating from its surface, was held firmly in the hand.  The determined expression on the hand conveyed a readiness to strike, the scene crackling with power.
31.29.A.jpg;  The man with black hair stood, his back to the viewer,  his gray jacket a stark contrast to the red-haired man's shocked expression.  "Sung... how did you?!"  the red-haired man exclaimed.
31.29.B.jpg;  The man with purple hair,  holding his sword, smirked as he observed the black-haired man.  "If you were a power type, then unleashing that kind of strength would've been possible for even an E-rank."  he mused.  "However, seeing your reaction speed just now... you're not normal. You did block my attacks two times after all." 
31.30.A.jpg;  "Then, are you an assassin type?" the voice questioned,  a hint of curiosity laced in the tone.  "No, that's not it either." it continued,  a sense of nonchalance emanating from the speaker.
31.30.B.jpg;  The man with purple hair,  a smirk playing on his lips,  stared at the man across from him.  "You've been hiding your strength, haven't you?"  he questioned,  the tension between them palpable.
31.31.A.jpg;  The man with orange hair,  his face contorted in confusion, stared at the speaker.  "A fake ranker? No, it looks like you've known them for a long time so that can't be it." he muttered,  struggling to comprehend the situation.
31.31.B.jpg;  "There's no way a fake ranker would let anyone who saw their real power live." the woman in the brown jacket said.  "Then there's only one answer -."  she paused, her eyes fixated on the figure in the center.  
31.31.C.jpg;  The man stood tall, his silhouette bathed in a blue glow, his eyes radiating an intensity that hinted at his reawakening.  "You've been reawakened." the voice declared, the statement carrying a weight of significance.
31.32.A.jpg;  The man stood poised, his blue jeans and black jacket blending into the blue background as he assumed a fighting stance.  His leg was raised, his body radiating power and energy. 
31.32.B.jpg;  "Mr. Sung?!" the woman exclaimed, her blue eyes wide with shock.  "Reawakened??" she repeated, disbelief coloring her voice. 
31.33.A.jpg;  "By their reactions... you've been reawakened recently, huh." the man with purple hair mused, a smirk playing on his lips.  "Thinking about it, recently my boss did go to see someone because he thought he was reawakened...  Anyways, it seems like you have little experience in being a hunter." he added.
31.33.B.jpg;  "In that case..."  the man with purple hair declared, his two swords held firmly in his hands, his gaze unwavering.

32.8.A.jpg;   The man,  his eyes fixed on the bag overflowing with Korean won,  reached inside,  his fingers tracing the edges of the crisp bills.  "Why pick them up and throw them in the trash, then?" he mused.

33.21.C.jpg;  The man pondered the situation, his brow furrowed in thought. "Was he not an assassin type?  An offense class hunter with healing spells actually exists?! he mused. Relying on this alone definitely has its limitations I gotta think of other solutions.
33.22.A.jpg;  The mans gaze flickered between doubt and curiosity. A trick? he wondered aloud. Or perhaps faked confidence? How many times can he use that spell? I cant tell.

The purple-haired man chuckled, his words echoing with a chilling familiarity. I see, he murmured, his gaze fixed on the orange-haired man.
33.29.A.0.jpg;  The man stood amidst a surge of blue light, his eyes wide with surprise.  There are many ways of life and death, a voice echoed, its words carrying a weight of profound understanding.

33.30.A.jpg;  A smug smirk played on the man's lips, his confidence radiating outwards. Looks like his appearance wasn't the only part of him that changed, a voice commented.  Awakening, another voice chimed in. Such an unexpected power changed the rules of society. 
33.30.B.jpg;  The man stood with a fierce determination, his blue blade held aloft. New exclusive rules for hunters were created, a voice declared.  "There's no need to be shackled by laws or morals."  The words of the strong are the law, another voice added, echoing the man's newfound power.
33.30.C.jpg;  His face was shrouded in shadow, only his eyes visible, one a blazing red, the other a deep purple.  A determined glint flickered in his eyes. And therefore, Im going to unleash my full power, he vowed.
33.31.A.jpg;  A storm raged across the land, dark gray clouds swirling in the sky.  White light flickered across the ground, a testament to the devastation unleashed.  The air hung heavy with the stench of destruction.
33.32.A.0.jpg;  The man stood tall, a silhouette against the bright blue background, his eyes focused on the blue light emanating from his hand.  The energy pulsed around him, a tangible representation of his power.
33.32.A.1.jpg;  The man stood bathed in blue light, his arms outstretched, black lines pulsing around him. The energy hummed around him, a tangible representation of his power.
33.33.A.jpg;  The mans face was a mask of annoyance, his single red eye burning with frustration. Yeah, he growled. I think I know how he saw through my stealth.  Stealth may hide my presence when activated, but when I attack with high bloodlust, my presence is exposed for a fraction of a second. He's waiting for that moment.
33.33.B.jpg;  The two figures stood in a tense silence, each contemplating their next move. Even then, theres no way hed know where exactly Id attack, the purple-haired man stated.  I have to break the flow, the black-haired man countered, his gaze fixed on the ground.
33.34.A.0.jpg;  The mans face was shrouded in shadow, his gaze fixed on the ground.  A sense of foreboding hung in the air, the words "[Skill: Bloodlust was activated]" appearing in the middle of the image.

33.36.A.jpg;  The ocean churned around him, its white waves a stark contrast to the dark blue depths.  The man, clad in a dark suit, fought against the relentless current, his struggle a testament to his desperation.

33.39.A.0.jpg;  Dark blue smoke swirled around, obscuring the setting in an ominous veil.  The words "What, is this?"  appeared above the smoke, a question hanging heavy in the air.  The darkness that covers my eyes a voice whispered, its words echoing the creeping dread.

33.41.A.0.jpg;  He stared in disbelief. "Y you, what" he stammered, his eyes filled with shock.
33.41.A.1.jpg;  His body contorted in pain, his mouth twisted in a grimace. Blood stained his white shirt, a stark contrast to the blue blade protruding from his chest. 
33.42.A.jpg;  His blue eyes narrowed, radiating an aura of power. His expression was stern, a testament to his dominance.
33.42.B.jpg; The Korean text, written in dark blue, appeared on the screen, its message unspoken but understood.
34.0.A.jpg;  A white to black gradient stretched across the screen, the transition smooth and seamless. In the top left corner, a green circle encircled the number "34." signaling a new chapter.
34.0.B.jpg;  White splatters scattered across the black canvas, a chaotic backdrop to the red inscription.  "He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster. And if you gaze long into an abyss." the words resonated with a stark warning.
34.1.A.0.jpg;  White splatters danced across the black canvas, forming a chaotic yet artistic background for the title card.  The Abyss, the words resonated in red, a promise of mystery and danger.
34.1.A.1.jpg;  The quote from Friedrich Nietzsche, etched in red against the white splatters, sent a shiver down the spine. "also gazes into you.  Friedrich Nietzsche.  The words whispered a chilling truth, a sense of unease and dread settling over the reader. 
34.2.A.0.jpg;  The words on the screen painted a somber picture. "Because its usually a life or death situation, they not only fight against monsters, but amongst themselves as well.  The next line, "We are already 'perfect' killing machines." echoed the grim reality of their existence. The final statement, "Same goes for you." was a chilling reminder of their shared fate.
34.2.A.1.jpg;  A blue blade protruded from a chest, its sharp point a stark reminder of the brutal reality.  "You wouldnt lump hunters and ordinary humans into the same category, would you? the text above asked, a pointed question. So the second line trailed off, leaving the answer hanging in the air.
34.2.B.jpg;  His red eyes stared blankly ahead, his chest stained with blood. A sense of defeat clung to him, the words "Ill die because I lost" echoing the truth of his situation.
34.3.A.jpg;  He stood amidst the broken floor, his shirt stained with blood, his face etched with pain. "Its only natural." the text above stated, a harsh reminder of the worlds cruel indifference.
34.3.B.0.jpg;  His red eyes darted around, confusion etched on his features.  Let me ask you just one question, the text above read.  What are you? the question hung in the air, a challenge to unravel the mystery surrounding him.
34.3.B.1.jpg;  The man stood, his expression a mix of curiosity and confusion.  An assassin class with healing magic and even debuff abilities, the text above stated, a revelation that defied expectations. Ive never heard of anything like it. 
34.4.A.jpg;  He looked around, his expression a mixture of uncertainty and confusion. Hm Im not sure either, he admitted. 
34.5.A.jpg;  He stood, his gaze unwavering, his determination clear. "A babble-mouth may be useless, the text below stated. But having a lot of secrets isnt that great either."
34.5.B.jpg;  A pained expression twisted his face as a series of notifications appeared below him. Kuk! he groaned, his body contorting. [Effect: Paralysis was activated.]  [Effect: Bleed was activated.]
34.6.A.jpg;  Anger flared in his red eyes, his face contorted in a grimace.  "You wont be able to hide your skills anymore since you killed me." the text above proclaimed, a chilling threat.

34.7.A.jpg;  His gaze was unwavering, his expression resolute. Lets say Im a hunter that grows stronger from each fight, he stated.  How strong do you think I can get? he challenged, turning his gaze towards the purple-haired man below.
34.8.A.jpg;  He looked down at his blood-stained clothes, his face a mask of shock and confusion. Huh he breathed.  
34.8.B.jpg;  The man sat on the ground, his eyes wide with fear and confusion.  Your shadow the man standing behind him stated.  The purple-haired man flinched, his gaze darting between the man and the shadow that seemed to loom behind him.
34.9.A.jpg;  His eyes darted back and forth, fear and uncertainty clouding his expression.  Is connected to the darkness, the text above whispered.  You will become, the words continued, a chilling prophecy. As strong as your shadows depth in the dark.
34.9.B.jpg;  The man stood tall, a triumphant grin spreading across his face. Quest complete, the words echoed below him. You have completed [Emergency Quest: Kill the Enemies!]
34.11.A.jpg;  A satisfied smile played on his lips as he surveyed his surroundings. I certainly got much, much stronger than before, he mused.
34.11.B.jpg;  His hood was pulled up, casting shadows over his face, his expression filled with worry.  But for some reason he murmured.
34.12.A.jpg;  He stood with his hood pulled up, his gaze fixed on the ground. A sense of unease clung to him, his face reflecting a deep internal struggle. "I feel like something within me is lost every time I get stronger, he whispered.  Jin-woo he murmured, a sense of longing in his voice. Thank you.
34.12.B.jpg;  His face beamed with relief, his smile genuine and heartfelt.  Thanks, Mr. Sung, he said.  We wouldve died if you werent here. 
34.13.A.jpg; The man in black stood amongst the three, worry etched into his face. "Now what should we do about this situation...?" he muttered, his gaze drawn to the injured man at his feet. 
34.14.A.0.jpg; "We should close the dungeon gates first." the man in black commanded. The blond man, startled by the unexpected situation, stood frozen, his eyes wide with fear.
34.14.A.1.jpg; "Don't tell me you're going to solo the bo-"  the voice trailed off, a mix of disbelief and admiration.  "No, I've seen your skill." the man admitted, respect evident in his tone. 
34.14.B.jpg;  "I do want to give them a proper burial, but..." the man with ginger hair sighed, his gaze sweeping over the bodies in the rocky cave. "Such a pity." he added.
34.15.A.jpg;  The man crouched low, his black and blue blade glinting in the dim blue light, his eyes locked on his target. He plunged the blade into the black object, the act fuelled by a fierce determination.
34.15.B.jpg;  A blue light pulsed from the man's chest, bathing him in an ethereal glow.  "Alarm..." the message flashed on a blue rectangle.  "-You have received [Rune: Stealth]."  another message appeared, its words shimmering. 
34.16.A.jpg;  The man held the blue and gray stone in his hand, his gaze focused.  "[Rune: Stealth]"  the words displayed on a green rectangle, followed by a detailed description.  "I can obtain his skill after killing him?" he pondered, his mind already strategizing.
34.16.B.jpg; "We'll go first and report to the guild." the man with ginger hair declared.  "Hurry, we'll be waiting outside." the woman with orange hair added, her words echoing his urgency.
34.17.A.jpg;  "Don't worry, it won't take long." the man assured, his back to the viewer as he walked away. The man in the orange jumpsuit lay on the ground, his form still, a stark reminder of the danger they had just faced.
34.17.B.jpg;   "I know you're alive." the man said.  "Get up." he urged, his gaze fixed on the injured man. The man lying face down on the ground looked up, his eyes wide with surprise. 
34.19.A.jpg;  "Why did you try to act dead?" the man in the dark grey jacket demanded, his tone accusatory. "You trying to run without anyone knowing?" he pressed, his gaze unwavering. 
34.19.B.jpg;  "Ah, you can't talk." the man observed, his eyes fixed on the injured man. "Kang Tae-Shik was pretty brutal." he continued.  "He precisely cut only the vocal cords... probably would've killed you in the most painful way possible after ensuring you wouldn't be able to scream."
34.20.A.jpg;  Covered in blood, the man clutched his chest, his face contorted in terror. "Ye... yes, I'm saved." he stammered, a flicker of hope in his eyes. "If we ask Miss Ju-Hee, you'd probably live." a voice whispered, its words offering a sliver of comfort. 
34.20.B.jpg;  "This isn't the way out!" a voice cried out, panic rising in its tone.  "Stay still." another voice boomed, its words firm and reassuring.  "Wait... this way is..." the voice trailed off, uncertainty creeping into its words. 
34.22.A.jpg;  The man's eyes, wide with fear, darted towards the wooden door behind him.  Terror gripped him, his every instinct screaming to escape the unknown lurking beyond. 
34.22.B.jpg;  Four menacing figures stood silhouetted against the backdrop, their red eyes gleaming malevolently.  Their weapons glinted in the dim light, a silent promise of imminent danger. 
34.23.A.jpg;  The creature, its red afro towering above him, grinned, its teeth sharp and menacing. The man stood frozen, his back to the creature, his every nerve on edge.  Red eyes glittered in the background, their gaze fixed upon him, a silent threat. 
34.23.B.jpg;  "Do you remember the faces of all of your victims?" the man shouted.  The man in the grey jacket stood behind him, his arms crossed, a silent observer. 
34.24.A.jpg;  "You're trash even beyond Kang Tae-Shik." the man spat, disgust evident in his tone. "No way I'd take a monster like you outside." he declared, his words a cold condemnation.  
34.24.B.jpg;  Fear washed over the man's face as he glimpsed the large, dark figure behind him.  The weapon in its hand glinted ominously, while red eyes flickered in the background, a chilling reminder of the imminent danger.  
34.25.A.jpg;  Two green creatures with sharp teeth lunged at the helpless person, their menacing expressions revealing their intent to harm.  The attack was swift and brutal, leaving the victim with no chance to defend themselves.
34.25.B.jpg;  The man's face was contorted in terror, his eyes wide with fear.  Blood stained his collar, a grim reminder of the attack he had just endured. 
34.25.C.jpg;  The green hand clamped down on the man's jaw, its grip tightening, pain radiating through his face.  The creature's teeth glinted in the dim light, a terrifying sight that sent a shiver down his spine.
34.26.A.jpg;  The monster's hand, massive and powerful, crushed the person's arm with brutal force.  The bones snapped, sending a wave of agony through the victim, their cries echoing through the unknown setting.
34.26.B.jpg;  The monsters red eye gleamed with a cruel satisfaction as it sunk its teeth into the person's finger, the bone crunching under its pressure.  The victim's finger bled profusely, a testament to the monsters savagery. 
34.27.A.jpg;  The man stood tall, his gaze sweeping over the defeated figures lying sprawled on the ground.  Anger simmered within him, a potent mix of triumph and vengeance.
34.27.B.jpg;  The blood splatter, a grim testament to the carnage, painted the white background crimson.  A silent wail echoed throughout the distance, a haunting reminder of the lives lost. 
34.28.A.1.jpg;  The man stood on the edge of the cliff, his back to the viewer, a confident smile playing on his lips.  The defeated hobgoblin lay at his feet, its once menacing form now humbled, a testament to his skill.
34.29.A.jpg;  The woman with black hair spoke into her phone, a smile gracing her face.  Mr. Song Chi-Yul stood beside her, listening intently, his face reflecting the seriousness of the situation.
34.29.B.jpg;  A sleek black car sped down the street, its headlights cutting through the darkness, its arrival heralding a sense of anticipation and suspense. 
34.30.A.0.jpg;  "How many minutes have passed since the dungeon was cleared?" the man in the dark suit inquired, his smirk a hint of impatience.  "It's been about 40 minutes, sir." the woman replied.
34.30.A.1.jpg;  "Only 20 minutes left, then..." the man in the black jacket muttered, his brow furrowed with worry. "It's been too long. Try and recover the victim's bodies within 8 minutes, if impossible, quit and return back." he instructed, his tone firm.
34.30.B.jpg;  "Did the survivors clear the dungeon themselves?" the woman asked.  The man with red hair stood beside her, his gaze fixed on a point in the distance, his expression unreadable. 
34.31.A.0.jpg;  "Yes, sir." the man confirmed.  "Kang Tae-Shik tried to kill the remaining hunters during a contract assassination, huh..." he added, the gravity of the situation dawning on him. 
34.31.A.1.jpg;  "If that's true, then he would've intentionally left behind corpses, but he deliberately closed off the dungeon...?" the man with blonde hair mused, his brow furrowed in confusion.  "This means he had something to hide." he concluded. 
34.32.A.jpg;   The man with blonde hair stood amidst the group, his expression reflecting his growing unease.  The man with brown hair, his face flushed with anger, stood beside him, his hands clenched tightly.  The man with orange hair, his eyes wide with worry, stood between them, caught in the middle of the tension. 
34.33.A.jpg;  "Hunter Sung Jin-Woo?" the man in the black suit asked.  The man in the brown hooded jacket stood before him, his expression a mix of defiance and apprehension.
34.33.B.jpg;  "Is that Hunter Sung Jin-Woo from last time?" the man in the black suit asked, his gaze lingering on the man in the brown hooded jacket.  "I couldn't even recognize him at first." he admitted, a flicker of surprise in his eyes.  "We meet again, Hunter." the man with black hair said, a hint of familiarity in his tone. "Ah, you're the one from the monitoring division..." he acknowledged, a slight smile playing on his lips. 
34.34.A.jpg;  "My name is Woo Jin-Chul, head of the monitoring division." the man in the black suit introduced himself.  "It seems like one of our employees caused great harm." he stated, his expression grim.  "We'll hand you our official apologies after the case has been resolved, and the investigation division will handle the case instead of us." he assured, his tone sincere. 
34.34.B.jpg;  "It's not the time to be full of myself just because I killed the B-Rank Hunter Kang Tae-Shik." the man with black hair muttered, a sense of humility in his voice.  "I didn't know before, but..." he trailed off, his thoughts swirling. 
34.35.A.0.jpg;  "This person is strong." the man in the black suit stated.  "As a member of the monitoring division, I have a few questions." he continued, his gaze unwavering.
34.35.A.1.jpg;   "Things would run very smoothly if you cooperated - will that be okay?" the man in the hooded jacket asked. "He's an A-Rank!" he exclaimed, a mix of awe and fear in his tone. "He's in a different league of his own! I can't handle him with my strength right now." he confessed, his shoulders slumping. 
34.36.A.jpg;  "Then let me ask this directly - who killed the B-Rank Kang Tae-Shik?" the man in the black suit demanded, his fist clenched, his anger barely contained. 
34.37.A.jpg;  The three stood in a circle, their faces a mixture of shock and disbelief.  The man in the suit, his back to the camera, seemed to be the center of their confusion, the weight of the revelation settling upon them. 
34.38.A.0.jpg;  "I probably can't hide that I've been re-awakened now." the man with brown hair admitted.  
34.38.A.1.jpg;   "Looks like I'll have to void my contract with Jin-Ho." the man with black hair sighed, his brow furrowed with concern.  "Since he wants a skillful, yet low-ranked hunter." he explained, a hint of sadness in his voice.
34.38.B.jpg;  "It was me." the man with black hair confessed.  The man with blonde hair, his back to the camera, stood frozen, his silence speaking volumes. 
34.39.A.jpg;  "I'm the one that killed Kang Tae-Shik." the man with blonde hair announced, a hint of pride in his voice. "If you don't mind, would you tell me your rank?" he inquired, his curiosity piqued.  "C-Rank." the man replied.  "How could you beat a B-Rank as a C-Rank...?" he questioned, his disbelief evident in his voice. 
34.39.B.jpg;  "Do you not see who's behind me?" the man with blonde hair demanded, his tone sharp.  The woman with orange hair, caught between them, stared wide-eyed, her fear palpable. 
34.40.A.0.jpg;  "Well... if you did receive support from a B-Rank, I guess you could've beaten him." the man with brown hair conceded, a reluctant nod of acknowledgement.  The man with purple hair, his eyes wide with shock, seemed to be struggling to process the information. 
34.40.A.1.jpg;  "But Kang Tae-Shik... he was someone that couldn't be controlled even within the division." the man in the dark suit admitted, a hint of frustration in his voice.  "Could a one-armed C-Rank really beat a skilled B-Rank assassin in combat?" he questioned, his skepticism evident.  "Come with me for now. I'm afraid I'm going to need your help in filling out some reports." he instructed, his tone shifting to a more pragmatic one. 
34.41.A.jpg;  "Mister." the man with blonde hair called out. The group of men in suits stood frozen, their gazes fixed on the approaching figure.  Petals drifted down from the sky, a delicate contrast to the tension that permeated the scene.
34.41.B.jpg;  "Why did you lie?" the man in the dark jacket demanded.  "I just assumed you had enough reason to hide your abilities." he explained, his tone defensive. "What, was I wrong to do so?" the man in the orange jacket countered. 
34.42.A.jpg;  "You can't escape the investigations anyways." the man with blonde hair said.  "I can't pay you back for what you've done, but this is the least I can do for now." he added, his gaze fixed on the ground. 
34.42.B.jpg;   "Hunter Sung Jin-Woo." the man in the black suit confirmed.  The man in the dark hooded jacket stood silently, his gaze fixed on the man in the suit, a silent acknowledgment of the introduction. 
34.43.A.0.jpg;  "I don't think an E-Rank like you could've defeated a B-Rank like Hunter Kang Tae-Shik." the man stated. "I also think that it's unnecessary to suspect you of re-awakening again." he added, his tone softening. 
34.43.A.1.jpg;   "However, let me tell you this." the man continued.  His words, though obscured by his hair, carried a weight that demanded attention.
34.43.B.jpg;   "What do you mean?" the man in the dark jacket asked, his brow furrowed with confusion.  "In the extermination of Huang Dong-Suk's assault team." the man in the black suit explained. "The only survivors were a D-Rank and you." he stated, his words carrying a chilling implication. 
34.45.A.0.jpg;  "The problem is that Huang Dong-Suk's younger brother, Huang Dong-Su, may seek revenge on you guys." the man with black hair explained.  "You're talking about the S-Rank Huang Dong-Su?" the man asked.  "Yes." the man confirmed, his tone grave. 
34.45.A.1.jpg;   "It doesn't matter what actually happened during that raid." the first text declared, a chilling reminder of the power of perception. "The important fact is that you, Sung Jin-Woo, survived." the second text emphasized, highlighting the undeniable truth.  "Since he's an S-Rank, the law can't really bind him either." the third text concluded, a sobering realization. 
34.46.A.jpg;  "They're living miracles and, at the same time, calamities." the text mused, a chilling reflection on the nature of their existence. "It'd be in your interest to watch out for him." the second text warned, a chilling reminder of the danger that lurked. 
34.46.B.0.jpg;  A sinister smile twisted the man's lips, his red eye gleaming with a malevolent light.  "Because you may be hunted by someone who even monsters fear." he declared.
34.46.B.1.jpg;  The man sat with a calm confidence, his hands resting in his lap, a sense of quiet power radiating from him. 
34.48.A.jpg;  "If possible, leaving the country with your loved ones isn't a bad idea." the man with pink hair advised.  His back to the viewer, he seemed to be lost in thought, his worry palpable.
34.48.B.0.jpg;   The man's eyes, piercing and focused, stared directly at the viewer, a silent command for attention.  His status, displayed beneath him, confirmed his strength and resilience. 
34.48.B.1.jpg;  The blue screen displayed a wealth of information, a testament to the man's progress.  His skills and equipment, a reflection of his growth and power, were laid out for all to see.
34.49.A.0.jpg;  "Jin-Woo." the woman with orange hair called out. "Do you remember this?" she asked, holding out the small object, her gaze searching his face. 
34.49.A.1.jpg;  A genuine smile lit up the woman's face, her eyes sparkling with happiness.  She held the object in her hand, a treasure to be cherished. 
35.1.A.jpg;   The man and woman stood under the flickering streetlight, their gazes locked, a silent understanding passing between them.  A sense of gravity hung in the air, the weight of their shared burden evident.
35.2.A.jpg;  "Jin-Woo, you've changed a lot." the woman with orange hair observed.  She stood behind the lamppost, her silhouette a poignant reminder of the distance that had grown between them.  
35.2.B.jpg;  "And I haven't changed a bit since then..." the man with orange hair said, a wistful smile gracing his lips.  His eyes, however, held a glint of determination, a reminder of the strength he carried within.
35.3.A.jpg;  "You've also experienced many different hardships - changing is different for everyone." the man in the dark hooded jacket observed.  His eyes, looking up at the sky, seemed to reflect the vastness of life's journey.
35.3.B.0.jpg;  "You're right." the woman with orange hair agreed.  Her eyes, focused on a point beyond the viewer, seemed to hold a hidden wisdom.
35.3.B.1.jpg;  "You know, I get scared way too easily to be a hunter." the woman confessed.  "I tried to overcome my fears, but it wasn't easy." she admitted, a touch of sadness in her tone. 
35.4.A.0.jpg;  "If you're a B-Rank healer, normally you'd join A-Rank or B-Rank dungeons." the woman explained.  "Even C-Rank if you're not conditioned well." she added, her smile widening.  "But I still joined D or E-Rank raids..." she continued, a hint of defiance in her tone. 
35.4.A.1.jpg;  "And then I constantly met you, Jin-Woo." the woman said.  "I kept healing the injuries that never stopped appearing on you." she admitted, her eyes reflecting the weight of her experiences.
35.5.A.jpg;  "To be honest, you got hurt so much it became pretty annoying." the woman confessed, a mischievous glint in her eyes.  "I thought you were stupid and vain at times..." she added, a chuckle escaping her lips. 
35.6.A.jpg;  "But..." the man exclaimed.  "You always managed to survive." the woman finished, her eyes wide with awe. 
35.6.B.jpg;  "Those eyes, brimming with life." the text mused,  "seemed like they were screaming for survival... for tomorrow." it concluded, a powerful testament to the man's spirit. 
35.7.A.jpg;  "But I don't think I'll ever be able to have those eyes." the woman admitted, a hint of wistfulness in her voice.  Her eyes, wide with wonder, reflected the depth of her admiration. 
35.7.B.jpg;  "You promised we'd eat together when we came back alive, didn't you?" the man in the black hooded jacket said.  His gaze, fixed on the unseen person, held a hint of disappointment.
35.7.C.jpg;  The hand, holding the small white object, paused, its movement halting mid-air.  "I'll... return this." the unseen voice whispered, a note of sadness clinging to its words.
35.8.A.jpg;  "Wait... are you..." the man gasped.  His eyes, wide with shock, seemed to be searching for answers.
35.8.B.0.jpg;  "I'm retiring." the woman with orange hair announced.  Her smile, radiant and infectious, lit up the forest around her. 
35.8.B.1.jpg;  The woman stood confidently, her orange hair cascading down her back.  She held the brown fabric in her hand, her gaze fixed on the viewer, a silent invitation to join her. 
35.9.A.jpg;  "I'm gonna head back to my hometown, Busan." the woman declared.  "Tell me if you ever visit! I'll buy you some fresh sashimi." she added, her smile widening.
35.9.B.jpg;   "If I come around." the man said, a friendly smile playing on his lips.  "I'll ask you to go out with me again." he added, a hint of hope in his voice.
35.11.A.jpg;  "Ok!" the woman exclaimed.  Her smile, wide and genuine, radiated a sense of joy and anticipation.
35.11.B.jpg;  The woman, carefree and full of life, leaped into the air, her laughter echoing through the forest.  Her happiness, a vibrant bloom against the pink tree, was a testament to the joy she found in the simple pleasures of life.
35.12.A.jpg;  The man stood in the forest, the starry night sky above him, his gaze fixed on the distant horizon.  His expression was calm, his thoughts quiet, a sense of contemplation settling over him. 
35.13.A.jpg;  The man's fist, clenched tightly around a piece of paper, radiated determination.  "I just got another reason to become stronger." the text above it declared, a promise whispered in the face of adversity. 
35.13.B.0.jpg;  The man's red eyes gleamed with a sinister light, his smile a cruel mockery of warmth.  "S-Rank Hunter Huang Dong-Su." the text above him announced, a chilling introduction to a formidable threat. 
35.13.B.1.jpg;  The starry night sky, a canvas of twinkling darkness, reflected the man's fear.  "I need to get stronger, fast." the thought bubble proclaimed, echoing the urgency of his desperate wish.  "Only then will I survive." the second bubble affirmed, a stark reminder of the stakes. 
35.14.A.jpg;  The vast expanse of stars, glittering against the black velvet of the night sky, held a sense of profound emptiness.  The silence, broken only by the distant whispers of the universe, whispered of solitude and isolation. 
35.15.A.0.jpg;  "Look, Yoo Jin-Ho." the man said, his gaze fixed on the distant mountains.  His expression, a mix of concern and determination, reflected the weight of the situation. 
35.15.A.1.jpg;  "What's all this?" the man exclaimed, his face contorted in confusion.  His eyes, wide with uncertainty, reflected the fear that gripped him.
35.16.A.0.jpg;  The injured man, his face stained with blood, stood amidst the group, his gaze fixed on the ground.  "What do you mean, 'all this'?" the man with dark hair asked. 
35.16.A.1.jpg;  "They're our teammates for today!" the man with orange hair announced.  His eyes, wide with anticipation, reflected his enthusiasm. 
35.17.A.jpg;   The man's leg, encased in a white cast, was a stark reminder of his recent struggle.  "Those who have a hunter's license but can't attend raids due to various reasons." the text above explained.  "Injured." the text in the corner confirmed, a chillingly simple statement. 
35.17.B.jpg;  The man with black hair, his gaze fixed on the viewer, appeared bored and apathetic.  "Alcoholics." the text below him stated, a stark description of his situation.  "Those who are struggling in life because of various reasons were drafted into our team." the text above explained, a stark reminder of the hardships they had faced. 
35.18.A.jpg; The woman stood alone by the tree, her gaze fixed on the ground. The words "there are also some who came here for a quick cash grab..." floated above her, a reminder of the greed that sometimes drove people to the dangerous dungeons. 
35.19.A.jpg;  "Is a kid even allowed to do raids?" the man in the red jacket asked. The other man, beaming, replied, "If an underaged kid is awakened, then there's no law banning them from raids." 
35.19.B.jpg;  "Kid? That's rude." the woman retorted, her hands shoved deep into her pockets.  "I'm a full-fledged hunter." 
35.20.A.jpg;  "You're a high schooler, right? Do you have any raid experience?" the man in the red jacket asked, looking down at the hooded figure.  "N... none." he stammered, "E-rank, I assume?" 
35.20.B.jpg;  "Well, it's okay. You don't have to follow me into the dungeon - just wait outside." the man said confidently. "Only Jin-ho and I will go in."  The woman looked unsure, her gaze fixed on the ground. 
35.21.A.jpg;  "We weren't allowed to attempt the C-rank dungeon with just the two of us, so that's why we brought you guys as well." the man with brown hair explained, his smile bright.  "By law, a C-rank raid needs 10 people."
35.21.B.jpg;  "A C-rank dungeon with just the two of them?" the man in the blue shirt asked, his eyes wide with surprise.  "Are they really that strong?" 
35.22.A.jpg;  "Yes, of course." a voice boomed, a hand in a red glove raised in the air. "3 million won per raid for each of you!"  "Pretty darn good deal, considering that you don't have to lift a finger."
35.22.B.jpg;  "All you have to do is wait for us outside until we finish." the man with the baseball cap said. "However, you must not tell anyone what you've seen or heard here. If you do, you must pay back 10 times as much as you earned - it's all written in the contract you've signed." 
35.22.C.jpg;  "But you know, I've been wondering..." the man in the black jacket muttered, his gaze fixed on something out of sight.  His expression was a mix of confusion and curiosity.  
35.23.A.0.jpg; "What the hell are you wearing?" a voice echoed, but the man in the shining red armor only smiled wider. His stance was strong, his confidence radiating, and the intricate details of his armor gleamed in the bright light. 
35.23.A.1.jpg;  "It's a full set of hardened armor made in an Italian artisan guild." the man explained. "If we're going to raid with just the two of us, shouldn't I prepare at least this much?"  
35.24.A.jpg;  The man in the red jacket pointed a finger at the armored figure, who lay sprawled on the ground, his expression one of shock.  "What happened?!" the man in the red jacket demanded. 
35.25.A.jpg;  "Please help me up." the man in the armor gasped, his face contorted in pain. The man in the red jacket stood above him, his anger a dark cloud that seemed to press down on the scene. 
35.25.B.jpg;  "Alright! Let's get going brother!" the man in the red helmet announced.  "I'm nervous..." he muttered under his breath, his hand clutching the brown bag slung over his shoulder.  
35.26.A.jpg;  "What... is that?" the man in the red and black jacket exclaimed, his eyes wide with disbelief.  "Are you serious?" he whispered. 
35.27.A.jpg;  "Ha... fine, fine... let's hurry." one of the men said.  "I brought the helm just in case..."  "They're going to raid the C-rank dungeon by themselves?" the other man asked. "They don't look that strong..." 
35.27.B.jpg;  "If they're strong enough to clear C-rank dungeons by themselves, then wouldn't it be better to clear high-ranked dungeons given from large guilds?" the man with the cigarette asked. "What happens if they both die?"  "Well, we did receive our money, so..." he said. 
35.27.C.jpg;  "E-rank hunter Sung Jin-woo - I know him." the man in the blue shirt said.  "He's known as the "world's weakest hunter".
35.28.A.jpg;  "That name, what..." the man in the blue shirt whispered, his face a mask of shock.  "And our raid leader's a D-rank." the man in the brown jacket added. 
35.28.B.jpg;  "Tsk, they're showing off, I guess." the man with the cigarette muttered, a hint of annoyance in his voice. "Youths showing off will naturally harm many people."
35.29.A.jpg; The clock tower's hands ticked past 2:50, each second a precious heartbeat.  The man in the red helmet with horns, a brown jacket slung over his shoulders, sprinted forward, his every movement a testament to urgency and determination. 
35.29.B.jpg;  "Oh, you came back alive?" the man in the blue shirt asked.  "Looks like you ran away successfully!" 
35.30.A.jpg; "Thank god." the blonde-haired man breathed, his relief palpable.  "Wait, he wasn't running away!"  "Look at that!" the others echoed, their surprise echoing in the air.
35.30.B.jpg; The G-Gate, a swirling vortex of blue energy, pulsed with power, its dark tendrils reaching out like grasping claws.  "The G-Gate is closing!" a voice cried, the urgency in their tone leaving no room for doubt. 
35.31.A.0.jpg;  "What?! They killed the B-Boss?"  the man in the red jacket exclaimed, his eyes wide with disbelief. "Where's the next one?" 
35.31.A.1.jpg;  "It's about an hour away from here." the man in the red helmet replied, his expression brimming with excitement. 
35.32.A.jpg;  "Alright, let's move." the man in the red helmet with horns barked. "We have to clear a total of three dungeons today."
35.32.B.jpg;  "I'm assuming you'll all go, considering it's easily 9 million for each of you?" the man in the blue shirt asked.  "Ah... ah, yes. Of course..." one of the men stammered.  "They're raiding again, after destroying a C-rank dungeon all by themselves?" 
35.33.A.jpg;  "What are they?!" the woman exclaimed.  Her eyes were wide, her gaze fixed on the scene unfolding before her. 
35.34.A.jpg;  "Sir! L-look at this for a moment!"  the voice boomed, a sense of urgency hanging in the air.  The White Tiger Guild's headquarters loomed in the distance, a beacon of power against the bright blue sky. 
35.34.B.jpg; "What?! 200 million and 5 thousand?" the man in the blue suit jacket exclaimed, his eyes wide with disbelief.  "Someone actually used 200,005,000 won to earn the rights to clear a C-rank raid? Recently, a team has started buying the rights for every C-rank gate that appears. So, there are no more gates for our low-tier hunters to raid!"
35.35.A.jpg; "It was originally 7 thousand, but even when I increased it all the way to 100 million, they bought the rights for 200 million and 5 thousand." the man said. A hand rested on his shoulder, a silent gesture of support. 
35.36.A.jpg;  "The team leader's name is Yoo Jin-ho?" the man asked, his brows furrowed in thought. "I've never heard of him."  "I believe he's the second son of the CEO of Yoo-jin Architectures." a voice chimed in.  "It seems like he's buying gates with the support of the company. But, it's still a loss for them. For a future CEO, aren't his antics a bit extreme?"
35.36.B.jpg;  "Gee-chul, wasn't there a survivor of that double lair about two or three months ago?"  the man asked.  "Yes, his name was..."  "Sung Jin-woo, am I right?" 
35.37.A.jpg; "Yes, that's right." the man replied.  "This, this... it smells like an opportunity."  His hand was under his chin, his gaze fixed on a point beyond the room, his mind racing with possibilities. 
35.37.B.jpg; "Everyone, stop what you are doing! D-rank hunter Yoo Jin-ho and E-rank hunter Sung Jin-woo." a voice boomed, demanding attention.  "Find everything there is about those two people!"  The air crackled with urgency, the weight of the task settling upon them like a heavy blanket. 
35.38.A.jpg; The sound of wheels rolling across the floor echoed in the room, a stark contrast to the quiet intensity of the moment. The pink shirt, barely visible under the black pants, was a reminder of a normalcy that felt a world away. 
35.38.B.jpg;  "Right now!" the voice roared, the word a call to action.  Excitement crackled in the air, a tangible energy that pulsed with the promise of something new, something grand. 
36.1.A.jpg;  "Sung Jin-woo has made it through three accidents safely so far." a voice muttered, concern laced through the words.  The man in the white shirt, his back to the viewer, was engrossed in the white screen, the weight of the world seemingly resting upon his shoulders. 
36.2.A.0.jpg; A wicked grin spread across the man's face, his eyes gleaming with malice. "First was the double lair incident." he cackled, the words dripping with dark satisfaction. "Second was the death of Hwang Dong-suk's entire party. Third, the most recent case, was the guild's monitoring supervisor's murder incident. Sung Jin-woo and Yoo Jin-ho became acquainted during the second case." 
36.2.A.1.jpg; "And the most important thing about Yoo Jin-ho is his relation to Yoo Jin Architectures..." the man mused, his brow furrowed in thought. "There is a rumor going around that Chairman Yoo Meung-han is recruiting skilled hunters with the intent of founding a guild. If this is true, it won't be strange for Yoo Jin-ho to profit from this." 
36.3.A.jpg;  "The recruitment of skilled hunters." the man in the blue jacket stated.  "E-rank Sung Jin-woo, clearing C-rank gates with insane speed." The monsters in the background, a menacing tableau, seemed to shrink before his unwavering gaze. 
36.3.B.0.jpg;  "That means..." the man muttered, his eyes glued to the monitor, the blurred document a puzzle he was determined to solve.  His fingers tapped rhythmically on the desk, a testament to his focus and attention. 
36.3.B.1.jpg; "Hunter Sung Jin-woo could be a reawakened person!" the words on the monitor seemed to jump out, the revelation stark and unsettling. The document, a mine of information, lay open before him, a testament to the depths of his investigation.
36.5.A.0.jpg; The sleek, modern building stood tall, a symbol of ambition and power. "Hunter Sung Jin-woo is reawakened?!"  the words echoed in the man's mind, a shocking revelation.  "Yes, otherwise there's no way he would have survived these three incidents. Each time, it was a major accident where many of the participants died."
36.5.A.1.jpg;  The two men in suits, their faces etched with worry, hurried down the hallway.  "There's no other explanation for it." the man in the front said. They walked with purpose, their footsteps a steady rhythm against the sterile backdrop of the building. 
36.5.B.jpg;  "In the latest incident report, a C-rank magician and a B-rank healer combined their strength to stop the supervising hunter, but that's impossible." the man said. "He was a B-rank assassin. Magic doesn't work well against assassins, and he wasn't stupid, so he would have taken care of the healer first. In reality, it was a C-rank magician versus a B-rank assassin." 
36.6.A.jpg;  "That only leaves the possibility of someone else taking down the hunter from the monitoring department." the man in the white shirt said.  "Back then, the only survivors were the B-rank healer and the C-rank magician... and the E-rank hunter Sung Jin-woo. Nobody else. That only leaves one person to be suspicious of."  the young girl whispered. 
36.6.B.jpg;  "Where are we going right now?" the man with the brown bag asked.  "Where?"  The man in the suit, his gaze fixed on a point in the distance, didn't answer, his silence a testament to the urgency of the situation. 
36.6.C.jpg;  "We'll go scouting." the man in the white shirt said, his smile confident, his eyes unwavering.  He stood in the heart of the office, the air thick with anticipation, his plan laid out before him. 
36.7.A.jpg; The man, his white shirt a stark contrast against the dark blue of his pants, strode down the hallway, a determined expression etched on his face. The weight of the mission settled upon his shoulders, but he moved with purpose, the strap of his bag cutting a diagonal line across his chest. 
36.8.A.jpg;  "To think that the chief himself would go scouting..." the man in the suit exclaimed.  "This isn't a normal occurrence!"  "Let's go." the chief commanded. 
36.9.A.0.jpg;  A snarling werewolf, its brown fur matted with sweat, its teeth bared in a menacing grin, lunged forward, its eyes burning with a primal hunger. The darkness of the setting amplified the fear that pulsed through the air, the growl emanating from its throat a chilling warning. 
36.9.A.1.jpg;  The werewolf, its blue pants ripped, its red belt a stark contrast against its fur, stood in a tense pose, its eyes fixed on its prey. Smoke swirled around its body, the air thick with the smell of danger, its presence a palpable threat.
36.10.A.jpg; The man, his dark blue jacket blending into the mist, stood defiant, his gaze unwavering.  His determined expression was a beacon of strength, a testament to his power, a promise of retribution. 
36.10.B.jpg; The werewolf, its tongue lolling out, its eyes gleaming with a primal fear, turned and fled, its every movement a frantic dash for safety. Behind it, the blue, icy background was a chilling reminder of the power that pursued them, the three werewolves running in unison, their fear palpable in their every stride. 
36.11.A.jpg;  The werewolf, a dark silhouette against the blue, icy background, stood frozen, its back turned to the viewer.  Below, the blue, vibrant energy pulsed with power, lines of light crisscrossing, a testament to the energy unleashed, the movement swift and relentless. 
36.12.A.0.jpg;  The werewolf, its body bathed in blue energy, stood poised for attack, its red eye glowing with a fierce intensity. Its form was a blur of movement, its power a palpable force, a threat that radiated outward, its attack imminent. 
36.12.A.1.jpg;  The creature, its claws gleaming in the dim light, its red eyes burning with a primal hunger, moved with a ferocious speed, its form a blur of motion, a whirlwind of destruction. Its sharp claws, a deadly weapon, sliced through the air, a promise of imminent violence, the air crackling with the anticipation of a strike. 
36.13.A.0.jpg;  "Of of" the man whispered. his blue jacket barely visible through the red haze surrounding him. His eyes were focused, his expression determined, his power radiating outward, the image a whirlwind of energy and motion.
36.13.A.1.jpg; The man, a blur of blue against the red glow, moved with a speed that defied comprehension, his movements a symphony of power and precision. The intensity of the fight pulsed through the image, the energy radiating outward, each frame a testament to his strength.
36.14.A.jpg;  "Was he also hiding that skill all this time?" the man in the silver helmet exclaimed. His eyes were wide, his mouth agape, his shock palpable as he stared at the blue crystals protruding from the large rock, the pickaxe still clutched in his hand.
36.15.A.jpg;  "It seems like he's stronger than before..." the man in the blue jacket said. his expression a mix of concern and curiosity. The blue energy swirling around him was a visual testament to his enhanced power, the intensity of the moment a silent threat. 
36.15.B.jpg;  The status screen, a glowing blue canvas, displayed Sung Jin-Woo's stats, each number a testament to his strength. "Wolf Slayer", his title proclaimed, his level, 39, a testament to his growth. His HP, 7229, and MP, 638, were a reassuring display of his vitality. 
36.16.A.jpg;  "I've leveled up quite a bit, and obtained some fun skills." the man in the blue jacket said, a smile playing on his lips, his eyes wide with excitement.  He looked up at the status screen, the blue glow illuminating his face, the skills menu a testament to his progress. 
36.16.B.0.jpg; The man in the blue jacket, his expression serious, studied the rune, his eyes filled with determination.  The skills menu, a blue rectangle against the dark backdrop, displayed one active skill: stealth.  "It had the skill of Gang Tae-shik's corpse in it." the man mused. a hint of excitement in his tone.
36.16.B.1.jpg;   The man in the blue jacket, his gaze fixed on the blue mana potion, hesitated, a flicker of concern in his eyes. "It has a greater efficiency than my other skills." he thought. "But the continuous mana consumption is concerning..." 
36.18.A.0.jpg;  The creature, its brown fur bristling, its red eyes glowing with a primal rage, let out a deafening roar, its fangs bared in a menacing snarl. The air crackled with energy, the tension palpable, the creature's power a palpable threat. 
36.18.A.1.jpg;  The werewolf, its brown fur a blur of motion, its red eyes burning with fury, lunged at the man, its attack swift and brutal, the air rippling with the force of its assault.  The dark blur surrounding the man was a testament to the creature's power, the fear emanating from the scene undeniable. 
36.19.A.jpg;  "Advanced Dagger Arts." the skill description proclaimed, its words glowing on the blue background. "Dagger only - because you've used a dagger for an extended period of time, you can now use daggers more proficiently. - when a dagger is used, the attacks with it gain 33% additional damage."  Below it, "Vital Strike" pulsed with a fierce energy, its active nature promising devastating blows. 
36.19.B.jpg;  The man, his blue eye ablaze with determination, stood in the heart of the fight, his power radiating outward, the lines behind him a testament to the energy he commanded.  His focused gaze, his unwavering resolve, promised a swift and decisive victory. 
36.20.A.0.jpg;  The werewolf, its brown fur bristling, its red eyes burning with a primal ferocity, stood poised for attack, its three glowing circles pulsating with power.  Its large mouth, filled with sharp teeth, was a chilling reminder of the danger it posed.
36.20.A.1.jpg; The werewolf, its attack a blur of motion, struck the man, the force of the blow sending him reeling backward. The blue energy, a swirling vortex of pain, enveloped him, his vulnerability a stark reality. 
36.21.A.jpg;  "Alarm [You leveled up!]." The words glowed on the blue and green text box, the news a welcome surprise. The man's smile was a radiant beacon of joy, his eyes twinkling with excitement. 
36.21.B.jpg;  The man, his gaze fixed on the glowing lights, stood on the blue, rocky platform, his mind racing with questions. "Required level?" he murmured, his curiosity piqued.  The werewolf's leg and tail, a glimpse of the danger lurking in the shadows, served as a chilling reminder of the challenges that lay ahead. 
36.21.C.jpg;  "Alarm, he [player] has reached the required level." the blue screen proclaimed.  "Quest alarm, a [job change quest] has arrived."  The air crackled with anticipation, the words a call to adventure, the promise of a new beginning. 
36.22.A.jpg;  "Quest alert." the blue screen announced, its words stark and bold.  "Will you accept the quest?"  Two buttons, "Accept" and "Refuse." loomed below, the choice a momentous one, the path ahead uncertain. 
36.22.B.jpg; "Job change?" the man in the blue and black jacket whispered, a furrow in his brow, his expression a mixture of uncertainty and curiosity. The word echoed in his mind, a weight of possibility pressing upon him, the implications vast and unknown. 
36.23.A.jpg;  "What is this?" the man in the suit exclaimed. his eyes wide with shock.  "Name: Sung Jin-woo." the screen proclaimed.  "Level: 40. Job: None. Fatigue: 0."  The words hung in the air, a mystery waiting to be unraveled, the implications a source of both wonder and trepidation. 
36.23.B.jpg; A bright blue light pulsed from the portal, its ethereal glow illuminating the forest clearing. Five people, their faces etched with a mix of curiosity and confusion, watched the scene unfold. One man, his gaze fixed on the portal, seemed particularly intrigued. 
36.25.A.jpg;  "Why is everyone waiting outside the gate..." the man in the white shirt asked. "What's going on? Is this a playground?!"  His eyes darted around, taking in the scene before him, the forest a backdrop to the strange gathering.
36.25.B.jpg;  "This is a no entry zone, who are you two?"  the man in the white shirt demanded. his expression stern.  "Who's this kid?" he asked, his gaze fixed on the figure in the red jacket. 
36.25.C.jpg; "Kid, don't get in the way of an adult's work." the man in the white shirt barked, his anger palpable.  "Yeah, there's even a gate here, it's dangerous." the partially visible figure agreed. The woman in the red hoodie remained silent, her calm demeanor a stark contrast to the tension in the air. 
36.26.A.jpg;  "I'm a hunter too, so can you not treat me as a child?" the woman in the red hoodie retorted. "A hunter?" one of the men in suits scoffed. "Are you a member of this party as well?"
36.26.B.jpg;  "Yes." the woman replied. her gaze fixed on the ground. "Will things become awkward if I say that?"  Her face was a mask of uncertainty. 
36.26.C.jpg; "They didn't even enter the dungeon with their party members?!" one voice exclaimed, disbelief laced through the words.  "Sung Jin-woo! If my intuition is correct, you're a recruit that only comes once in a..." 
36.27.A.jpg;  "Comes once in a long time!" the man in the white shirt exclaimed, a wide smile spreading across his face. "You're special!" His eyes gleamed with excitement.
36.28.A.jpg;  "The party leader is returning!" the announcement echoed through the forest, a wave of anticipation washing over the gathering.  "Get ready to move!"  The air crackled with excitement, the promise of action palpable.
36.28.B.0.jpg;  "What's the schedule for tomorrow? I forgot that I had something important to do, so leave tomorrow's plans empty." the man in the dark blue jacket said. his eyes fixed on the woman in the helmet. The blue sparks dancing around them, a shimmering reminder of their power, added a sense of anticipation to the scene. 
36.28.B.1.jpg; "Tomorrow, sir?" the man with orange hair asked.  His right hand was raised, his white gloves catching the bright blue glow of the energy field surrounding him, his expression a mixture of shock and confusion. 
36.29.A.jpg; "I've already reserved the dungeons, but if it's urgent then I will cancel them." the man said. his index finger pointing at the phone screen.  "Is there really a need to cancel?" he asked.  
36.29.B.jpg;  "Sir, if you reserve a gate and don't enter within two days it cancels automatically." the woman in the dark grey helmet said.  Her expression, a mix of shock and curiosity, mirrored the unexpected news. 
36.30.A.jpg;  "Hm... then leave it reserved for now." the man in the middle said. The blue light pulsed behind them, its energy a tangible presence, its mystery a source of intrigue. "Hunter Sung Jin-woo." the words echoed in the air, a name that carried weight and power. 
36.30.B.jpg; The man, his gaze unwavering, stood resolute, his serious expression a mask of focus and concentration. His lips were slightly pursed, his eyes intense, his presence exuding an aura of authority. 
36.31.A.0.jpg;  "Nice to meet you. I'm the chief of the second department of management at the White Tiger Guild." the man in the white shirt said. confident baritone.  His surprise was evident, his brow furrowed slightly as he took in the scene before him.
36.31.A.1.jpg;  The man extended his hand, a white business card held in his palm, a gesture of formality and professionalism. His brown strap, a symbol of his status, hung over his shoulder, a subtle reminder of his position. 
36.31.B.jpg;  "White Tiger Guild?" the man in the blue jacket exclaimed, his eyes widening in surprise, his mouth slightly agape.  The white business card, a testament to the guild's power, was held out to him, a symbol of authority and influence. 
36.32.A.jpg;  "COFFEE." the black sign on the coffee shop proclaimed, its white text a beacon against the darkness.  Two bright blue lights illuminated the windows, a testament to the shop's vibrant energy. "Hunters, Reaper, Knights, fame, and us, White Tiger. You should've heard of those at least once." a voice boomed, its confidence echoing through the air. "Of course, the White Tiger Guild is one of South Korea's best guilds." 
36.32.B.jpg;  "I'll get to the point." the man in the red shirt said.  The atmosphere was charged with a sense of seriousness, the conversation poised to unravel a critical piece of the puzzle.  His gaze was fixed on the two others, his words carrying a weight of consequence. 
36.33.A.0.jpg; The man leaned back in his chair, his confident smile unwavering.  "We want to recruit you into the White Tiger Guild for twice the amount that Yoo Jin Architectures offered you." he said.
36.33.A.1.jpg;  He held his arms crossed, a thoughtful expression on his face. The text above his hands spoke volumes: "We want to recruit you into the White Tiger Guild for twice the amount that Yoo Jin Architectures offered you."
36.33.B.jpg; He leaned forward, his eyes intense. "There's no need to stall, get right to the decisive moment!" the text above his head demanded.
36.34.A.jpg; He smiled, a confident gleam in his eyes. "If you do well compared to your assumed skill, the pay can increase." the text below him promised.
36.35.A.jpg;  The man's eyes widened in disbelief. "How's that!" the text above his head exclaimed.  "It should be a surprising offer for a hunter who was E-Rank until recently!" the text below him added.
36.35.B.jpg;  He pondered the offer, a thoughtful frown etching across his brow. "How much is the White Tiger Guild's building price for you to make an offer like this?" the text above his head questioned.
36.36.A.jpg; The man's confusion was evident in his expression. "Excuse me?" the text above his head asked.  "What does that mean?" the text below his head clarified.
36.37.A.jpg;  "We're not using all the floors, but it should be around 50 billion." the text above the man's head stated.  "And you want to hand that over to me?" the text below the other man's head questioned.
36.37.B.jpg;  His confusion deepened, a startled expression spreading across his face.  "Eh? I'm not sure what you're talking about..." the text above his head mumbled.
37.0.A.jpg;  The man's jaw dropped in shock. "How much is the White Tiger Guild's building price for you to make an offer like this?" the text above him repeated, echoing his disbelief. 
37.0.B.jpg;  "Excuse me?" the text above his head questioned. "What does that mean?" the text below him clarified.  His confusion was palpable. 
37.1.A.jpg; "We're not using all the floors, but it should be around 50 billion." the text above his head stated. "And you want to hand that over to me?" the text below him questioned.  He looked at the man, a mixture of disbelief and shock on his face. 
37.1.B.jpg;  "Eh? I'm not sure what you're talking about..." the text above his head mumbled, beads of sweat forming on his brow.  He looked to the right, confusion etched on his face.
37.2.A.jpg;  The two men looked at the phone, their expressions a mix of disbelief and shock. "T-thirty billion?" the text above the phone read.  
37.3.A.jpg; The man at the table looked down, his face pale. In the next panel, a woman with black hair sat at a table, her face contorted in shock. Behind her, a man stood, his expression mirroring hers.  
37.3.B.jpg;  He sat at the table, his hand covering his mouth, his face a mask of worry. The text above the phone read "T-thirty billion?".  
37.4.A.jpg; "Yoo Jin's offered sum was a 30 billion won building." the text above the left man stated. "If you're offering twice their price, doesn't that mean you'll be offering your 50 billion won White Tiger Guild building?" the text below the right man questioned.  
37.4.B.jpg;  He stood there, his mouth agape, eyes wide with shock. "Just how great is his ability that Yoo Jin offered 30 billion for him?" the text above him questioned. "They haven't even reviewed his rank yet." it continued. "Is-isn't he just bluffing because there's no way to confirm it?" the text below him wondered.
37.5.A.jpg;  He looked at his phone, a serious expression on his face. "If you think I'm bluffing, I can confirm it for you." the text above his head stated. "Since he offered twice the amount, I thought he had even heard about my deal with Jin-ho, but it doesn't look like he knows about it." the text to the right of him mused.  
37.5.B.jpg;  He stood there, his mouth agape, his eyes wide with shock. "H... he's not bluffing!" the text above him exclaimed.  "U, um... such a high price goes past my abilities..." the text below him admitted. "If you give me some time, I can negotiate with the guild's higher-ups..." the text to the right of him pleaded.  
37.6.A.jpg;  "Then we're finished here." the text above his head stated, ending the meeting abruptly.  His face was etched with worry. 
37.7.A.jpg; He looked down, his face contorted in frustration. "Did I rush it too much?" the text above his head questioned. "If I had just found out the details of Yoo Jin's offer, got permission from the guild and took small and steady steps..." the text below him lamented.  
37.7.B.jpg;  He looked down, his brow furrowed. "Oh, right." the text above his head acknowledged. "How did you obtain this information about me?" the text to the right of him questioned.  
37.8.A.jpg;  He looked to his left, startled. "Did you research my back-ground?" the text above his head asked. "H, huh?" the text below him stuttered.  
37.8.B.jpg;  He stood there, his eyes wide with fear, beads of sweat forming on his brow.  He had been threatened.
37.10.A.jpg;  He looked down at the clipboard, his face pale. "S, stealth?" the text above his head whispered. "Don't turn around." the text to the right of him warned.
37.10.B.0.jpg;  He stood there, his expression serious, his brow furrowed. "I see! If he's a reawakened person who can even use stealth, then it makes sense that Yoo Jin would make such a careless offer!" the text above his head mused.  
37.10.B.1.jpg;  He looked to the right, a serious expression on his face. "Ah, I, I didn't order the research on purpose." the text above his head explained. "Somebody working in our guild noticed that somebody was clearing C-Rank dungeons at an extremely fast rate, so we dug into it and found you." it continued.  
37.11.A.jpg;  He stood there, his face serious, his blue eyes focused. "Three major accidents that occurred inside gates recently." the text above his head stated. "I have no evidence, but three times is not a coincidence anymore." it continued. "Because of your reawakening, you received abilities of a high-ranked hunter, and overcame all those accidents." it concluded. 
37.11.B.jpg;  A pair of blue eyes stared into the distance, smoke swirling around them. "Yoo Jin-ho must've seen your skill during the second raid, and is receiving a test from his father's guild similar to what you both are doing now." the text above the eyes explained. "Considering all those points, everything comes together, and we arrive to where we stand now." it continued. "How many people know about me?" the text below the eyes questioned. 
37.13.A.jpg;  "Just me and one of my subordinates." he stated, his face etched with concern.  "I wonder how Chief is doing." he mused. 
37.13.B.jpg;  A blue eye stared into the distance, smoke swirling around it. "It looks like I was noticed due to clearing C-Rank gates too quickly." the text above the eye stated.  "I do not want the number of people who know about me to increase." it continued. 
37.14.A.jpg;  He leaned forward, his expression serious.  "If, perhaps a rumor about me starts spreading, can I take it as your and your subordinate's responsibility?" the text above his head questioned.  
37.14.B.jpg;  He looked to the right, his brow furrowed, a small cut on his cheek.  "I'm required to formally report this to the Guildmaster..." the text above his head stated.  "But I don't want to die." the text below his head whispered.  
37.15.A.jpg;  He smiled, a confident gleam in his eyes.  "Gi-cheul..." the text above his head began.  "No, I'll warn my subordinate properly as well." it continued.  "Thank you." the text below his head stated.  
37.15.B.jpg;  He sat there, his arms crossed, a tired expression on his face.  "Because we cleared too many C-Rank dungeons, it looks like we've been a nuisance to the White Tiger Guild." the text above his head sighed.  "Unfortunately, we don't have any plans to stop for a while." it continued. 
37.16.A.jpg;  He leaned forward, his expression serious.  "That's a problem." the text above his head stated.  "We're running out of gates to train our new recruits." it continued.  "It's not like we can send them to higher-ranked gates..." it lamented.  
37.16.B.jpg;  He stood there, his jaw clenched, his eyes focused.  "Then how about we make a deal?" the text above his head proposed.
37.17.A.jpg;  A figure stood in the doorway, his jacket zippered, his dark blue interior peeking out.  He was ready.  
37.18.A.jpg;  He stood there, his mouth agape, his eyes wide with shock. "A... deal?" the text above his head echoed his disbelief.  
37.18.B.jpg;  He smiled, three fingers raised in a gesture of a deal.  "We'll sell three of our C-Rank gate reservations." he stated confidently. "Of course, this is a special offer only for today." he added.  "If you don't take this chance, it will be hard to reserve a C-Rank gate for a while." he warned.
37.18.C.jpg;  He looked at the viewer, his expression thoughtful.  "Are you a door-to-door salesman?" he questioned.  "Since gates don't only spawn in the metropolitan areas, we can train the recruits down in another province." he explained calmly.
37.19.A.jpg;  He looked at the viewer, a thoughtful expression on his face.  "The only problem is that it could create conflicts between us and other major guilds..." the thinking bubble above his head mused.  "I accept." the text below him stated.  "How much is it in total?" it continued.
37.19.B.jpg;  The man on the left stood there, his mouth agape, eyes wide with shock.  "Let's say 300 million each." the text above the man on the right's head stated.
37.19.C.jpg;  He stood there, his mouth slightly open, his eyes wide with shock. "The maximum price in mana crystals and magic crystals you can get from a C-Rank dungeon is 200 million!" the text above his head exclaimed.  "If you're selling for that price we will make a loss." the text below him stated. 
37.20.A.jpg;  He looked at the viewer, his face a mask of panic.  "300 million is a bit difficult for us so how about 200 million..." the text below him pleaded.  
37.21.A.0.jpg;  He stood there, his eyes closed, a smile gracing his lips.  "Okay then." the text above his head agreed.  
37.21.A.1.jpg;  He looked to the side, his eyes wide with surprise.  "Huh?" the text below him questioned.  
37.21.B.jpg;  The two men shook hands, a sense of accomplishment evident in their expressions.  "I... is it done?" the text above their heads asked.  "3 C-Rank gates, total 600 million. Please send it to my account." the text below them instructed.  
37.22.A.jpg;  He stood there, a determined look on his face, a small red container in his hand.  "Ah, and this is a gift from me." the text above him stated.  "Would you please open your mouth?" the text above the man on the right questioned.   "?" the text above the man on the right repeated, his eyes wide with shock.  
37.22.B.jpg;  He screamed, flames licking at his face, his eyes wide with terror.  The pain was unbearable.  
37.24.A.0.jpg; He stood there, his back to the viewer, his shoulders slumped.  "W... what, this ability?!" the text above him exclaimed.  "M-my wound?!" the text below him questioned.  "T, the fact that you just showed me your stealth and healing abilities... can I take that as a sign of your trust?" the text below him asked.  
37.24.A.1.jpg;  He stood there, his back to the viewer, his shoulders slumped, his face hidden.  "If it means that you will at least keep my secret." the text below him stated.  
37.24.B.jpg;  A man in a black suit walked toward a table where another man sat, pointing at the table.  "Chief!" he greeted. 
37.24.C.jpg;  He looked to the right, his eyes wide with shock, his mouth open.  "What was that light just then?" the text above his head questioned.  "Did things not go well with Sung Jin-Woo?" the text below him wondered. 
37.25.A.jpg;  He looked to the left, a small smirk playing on his lips.  "Gi-cheul..." the text above him whispered.  "I think we've met a much more formidable person than we thought." it mused.  
37.25.B.jpg;  He stood there, his back to the viewer, talking on the phone.  "Sir, it's been transferred." the text above his head stated.  
37.27.A.0.jpg;  He stood there, his face serious, his eyes wide with shock, talking on the phone.  "600 million, just like you said." the text above his head stated.  "To think that a canceled gate sold for this much... to whom did you sell it?" it continued.  
37.27.A.1.jpg; He stood there, his back to the viewer, his face hidden, talking on the phone.  "It's a trade secret." the text above his head stated.  
37.28.A.0.jpg;  A sign reading "2nd Manager's Office" hung above his head.  "Chief!" the text above him exclaimed.  "What? There are C-Rank gates left in our area?!" the text next to him questioned.  
37.28.A.1.jpg;  He stood there, his eyes wide with shock, his mouth agape, his face a picture of disbelief.  
37.29.A.jpg;  He held the phone to his ear, his eyes wide with shock, his expression one of disbelief. "Yes! And all the bidding prices are below 10 million won." the text above his head stated.  "Could it be..." the text below his hand wondered.  
37.29.B.jpg;  He stood there, his eyes wide with shock, his finger pointed at the phone.  "Yoo Jin-ho's team hasn't reserved a single C-Rank gate today." the text above his head stated.  
37.30.A.jpg;  He looked to the left, a worried expression on his face.  "I think we've been had, Chief." the text above his head stated.  "Yoo Jin-ho's team had no intention of raiding tomorrow from the beginning." it continued.  "I failed to scout Sung Jin-Woo and even got scammed!" the text below his head lamented.  "Does this mean..." the text below his head pondered.  
37.30.B.jpg;  He looked to the left, a concerned expression on his face.  "He did this without fear that I might reveal his identity?" the text above his head questioned.  "An unknown number?" the text below his head echoed his disbelief.  
37.31.A.jpg;  A phone screen displayed a text message: "You have a message. Unknown number xxx-xxxx-xxxx. This is Sung Jin-Woo. With this, I'll pretend you never did a background research on me."
37.31.B.jpg;  He stood there, a sly grin on his face, his eyes narrowed.  "Ugh... the deal was his background for money..." the text above his head mused.  "He's a tough one, really." it concluded.  
37.31.C.jpg;  He stood there, his eyes wide with surprise.  "Did he send the message after memorizing the number on my business card?" the text above his head questioned.  
37.32.A.jpg;  He stood there, a satisfied smile on his face, holding a phone in his hand.  "That's enough, let's be satisfied that we found out Sung Jin-Woo's number for now." the text above his head stated.  "Since our final goal is to recruit Sung Jin-Woo." it continued.  
37.32.B.jpg;  A cityscape stretched out behind him.  "The money we used today isn't much to the White Tiger Guild." the text above the buildings stated.  "I might get in trouble with the Guildmaster though..." it continued, his face etched with worry.  
37.34.A.0.jpg;  "Well." he stated, a sly smile playing on his lips.  He stood confidently in the forest, a mountain looming in the distance.  
37.34.A.1.jpg;  "Let's begin." he declared, his eyes gleaming with determination.  He stood ready for the challenge, his grey hoodie pulled tight.  
37.34.B.jpg;  The bright purple background pulsed with energy, white lightning bolts in the shape of hands crackling with power.  
37.35.A.0.jpg;  A burst of bright purple and white energy erupted, a chaotic force unleashed against a black backdrop.  
37.35.A.1.jpg;  He stood in the forest, watching the energy surge, a mixture of fear and awe in his eyes.  The forest around him was awash in purple and white hues.
37.36.A.jpg;  He smiled, a mischievous glint in his eyes.  "Job change." the text above him read.  "Seems interesting." the text below him mused.  
37.36.B.jpg;  He stood on a white cloud-like landscape, his grey hoodie pulled tight, his eyes fixed on the dark purple sky above.  
37.37.A.jpg;  A dark swirling vortex pulsed with pink, purple, and blue lighting.  "I wonder what kind of monsters will be in there." the text above it questioned.  
37.37.B.jpg;  Purple lines radiated from the center of a black void.  "At last, this game." the text above it declared.  
37.39.A.0.jpg;  A dark red curved structure, resembling a feather, stood against a black and white background, shrouded in mystery and intrigue.  
37.39.A.1.jpg;  A monstrous head, adorned with a red and orange helmet, glared out from the darkness, its white markings adding to its menacing presence.  
38.0.A.jpg;  He stepped into the hallway, its arched ceilings and dark wooden pillars hinting at a grand history, torchlight casting long shadows across the walls.  
38.1.A.0.jpg;  The knight stood tall, his dark armor gleaming, a sword with a gold hilt clutched firmly in his hand, radiating power and strength.  
38.1.A.1.jpg;  The knight's arm, encased in dark armor, was raised, the muscles beneath the metal hinting at the immense power that lay within.  
38.1.B.jpg;  The knight stood defiant, his black armor shimmering, facing a man with black hair who leaped through the air, a blue light surrounding his leg.  
38.2.A.jpg;  He surged forward, his right arm raised, a white streak of energy emanating from his fist, his face determined.  "[Active] Vital Strike Lv. 1. 70 mana. Dagger only - You have learned to attack efficiently. You now deal critical damage as you attack your foe's vital areas." the text above his shoulder read.
38.2.B.jpg;  He was thrown backward, his eyes wide with shock, his face a mask of surprise as a blurry figure kicked him from the side. 
38.3.A.0.jpg;  He raised his arm, a dagger gripped tightly in his hand, a beam of white light shooting from his fist.  "My attacks aren't dealing damage at all!" the text above him exclaimed.
38.3.A.1.jpg;  A shadowy figure, its armor glinting, charged forward, a blue light blast erupting from its foot, striking the ground with immense force.
38.4.A.jpg;  He spoke, his face determined, a hint of pride in his eyes. "He's not that strong." the text above him stated.  "It's just that his armor is too thick for my dagger to penetrate." the text below him clarified.  
38.4.B.0.jpg;  The armored figure raised its sword, a blue and white light blast erupting from the blade, its face set in a determined expression. "His movements are dull and his attacks don't have much force." the text above it stated.
38.4.B.1.jpg;  The armored figure stood firm, facing forward, as light blue streaks of energy struck its form from the left, a testament to the relentless attack.
38.5.A.0.jpg;  He stood there, a light blue energy emanating from his left hand, his eyes focused on the foe.  "His only good point is his defense." the text above him stated.  "He has no skill." it continued.  "Doesn't he know that the bigger the motion, the bigger the opening?" it questioned.
38.5.A.1.jpg;  The armored figure brought its sword down in a powerful arc, the blade slicing through the ground, rocks flying from the impact, its face determined.
38.5.B.jpg;  He stood there, his eyes wide with determination. "I already have experience against an opponent with armor so thick that my dagger didn't work on it!" the text above him declared.  
38.6.A.jpg;  His hand gripped tightly onto a large, dark object, his expression tense, his focus unwavering.   The urgency in his grip was palpable.
38.7.A.0.jpg;  He stood, his arm outstretched, his eyes fixed on his right hand, his body tense, ready to strike. The feeling of impending action filled the air.
38.7.A.1.jpg;  He punched, his fist clenched, his arm extended, a blue blur surrounding his fist, radiating energy.
38.8.A.jpg;  He stood, looking down at the armored figure, his expression one of annoyance. "A doll-type monster..." the text below him stated.  "This type of monster is weak against drawn-out battles." the text above the armored figure read. "Can you even call it a proper monster?" the text to the right questioned.  "It's going to be annoying if more of these guys show up in the future." the text below the figure lamented.  
38.8.B.jpg;  He stood, his hand holding a torch, the flame illuminating the darkness, casting eerie shadows.  "Since I'm using a torch instead of a luminous stone, it's pretty dark here." the text above his hand stated. 
38.8.C.jpg; Clutching the torch, the man scans the dark place,  his eyes tracing the text above his head.  "Like an instant dungeon, I can't exit until I clear it, so I have to conserve my mana as much as possible." he reads. 
38.9.A.jpg;  He glances at the notification, annoyance flashing across his face.  "The most annoying thing is that damage accumulates." he mutters,  his eyes fixed on the glowing text. 
38.10.A.jpg; The man stares at the screen, a mixture of worry and regret clouding his expression.  "Stealth and Vital Strike have good efficiency, but they also consume a lot of mana." he sighs.  
38.10.B.jpg; "Unknown difficulty, no healing, no retreat. This dungeon is too risky." he mumbles,  his eyes scanning the text. 
38.11.A.0.jpg; "How many hours... no, how many weeks it will take me to clear the quest.  So it's bad that I can't heal." he worries,  his gaze lingering on the dungeon walls. 
38.11.A.1.jpg; The man sprints across the barren landscape, his eyes darting around in panic. "If I take longer than 12 hours, I might become centipede prey like last time." he cries,  a wave of fear washing over him.
38.12.A.jpg; "This isn't good, I better get a job quickly and finish my daily quest." he thinks,  his pace quickening as he walks through the hallway.
38.13.A.0.jpg; The knights stand guard, their hands tight on their weapons.  "Before that..." one of them murmurs.
38.13.A.1.jpg; The knight crosses his legs, his gaze fixed on the man shrouded in flames.  "I'll have to take care of these muscle heads who only trust their defense." he states.
38.14.A.jpg; A smirk curls his lips, his eyes gleaming with anticipation.  The man is ready for a challenge,  his confidence radiating through his every move. 
38.14.B.jpg;  The man clenches his fist,  a surge of white energy swirling around it.  He prepares to unleash a powerful attack.
38.15.A.0.jpg;  The man throws a powerful punch,  his fist connecting with the knight's armor.  The impact sends a ripple of red energy through the air.
38.15.A.1.jpg;  His leg swings with incredible force,  the red sound effect echoing the power of his kick.
38.15.B.jpg;  The knight stands tall, his head tilted upwards,  black lines radiating from his body.  He emanates an aura of power.
38.16.A.0.jpg;  A surge of blue energy slams into the knight,  sending him reeling backwards.  His armor groans under the impact.
38.16.A.1.jpg;  The creature swings its glowing leg in a circular motion,  the blurred image conveying its raw power. 
38.16.B.jpg; The three figures clash in mid-air,  their movements a blur of energy and impact.  The gray lines in the background add to the sense of chaos.
38.18.A.jpg;  The knight stands tall, his helmet obscuring his face.  His menacing silhouette inspires a sense of fear and uncertainty. 
38.18.B.jpg;  The knight stands tall, his helmet obscuring his face.  The figure with glowing blue eyes leaps through the air,  its movements shrouded in mystery.  
38.19.A.jpg;  The man soars through the air,  his eyes glowing blue as he unleashes a powerful attack.  He lands a devastating blow,  the force of his strike sending the armored man flying backwards. 
38.19.B.jpg;  The knight stands tall, his gaze fixed on the figure soaring through the air.  The energy swirling around the figure sends a wave of unease through the knight. 
38.20.A.jpg; The man grabs the knight's chest, his hand tightening around the knight's neck.  The knight struggles against the man's grip, but his efforts seem futile.
38.20.B.jpg;  The man lunges forward,  his fist clenched tight.  He focuses all his energy on the black figure,  ready to strike.
38.21.A.jpg; The man stands over the fallen knight, his expression grim.  The knight's headless body hangs limp in the air,  a testament to the man's power.
38.21.B.jpg;  He stands over the defeated knight, his confidence unwavering.  "If I can't cut them, I can just target where their bones would be." he says.
38.23.A.0.jpg; "There's a few that drop some decent items." he says.
38.23.A.1.jpg; He examines the leather pouch and the high knight's chestplate,  his mind already planning how he'll use them.
38.23.B.0.jpg; "It's great that armor-type items don't force you to show their design." he says.  "If someone looked at me, I would become a laughing stock." 
38.23.B.1.jpg;  He stares at the translucent blue chestplate,  a wave of doubt washing over him.  "Will it really defend me even if it's manifested in reality?" he wonders.
38.24.A.jpg;  He opens the leather pouch,  a wave of excitement flooding through him.  "It's an item that contains gold. 30,000 in fact." he says,  his eyes shining with joy. 
38.25.A.0.jpg;  He pulls back his arm,  his eyes burning with fury.  He's ready to unleash his rage.
38.25.A.1.jpg;  He swings his arm,  a sharp object flashing in his hand.  His anger fuels his attack.
38.25.B.jpg; The person raises the sword,  a triumphant grin beneath the cloth.  "You have slain a knight!" the banner proclaims,  celebrating the victory.
38.26.A.0.jpg;  He turns his head,  a look of confusion crossing his face.  "Stealth? There are even monsters with stealth?" he questions,  a sense of unease settling over him. 
38.26.A.1.jpg;  He stands tall,  a beam of light radiating from his body.  He's determined to face whatever challenges lie ahead. 
38.27.A.jpg;  The magician raises his hand,  a glow emanating from his fingertips.  "A magician this time? Moreover, it uses blaze magic." he mutters,  his eyes narrowed in focus. 
38.27.B.jpg;  He stares at the figure,  a mix of confusion and suspicion clouding his expression.  "Stealth, and the same type of magic that Jo Gyu-hwan used, what's going on here?" he wonders.
38.28.A.jpg;  He stares at the figure,  a look of terror gripping his face.  "It's as if..." he whispers,  unable to comprehend what he's seeing.
38.28.B.jpg; "Fight from last time." he growls,  his eyes blazing with anger.  He stands ready to face the familiar foe.
38.29.A.jpg;  He sighs,  his eyes scanning the surroundings.  "This place is harder than I thought." he says.  "Since there are diverse types of monsters, I need to utilize different stats for each of them." 
38.29.B.jpg;  "Strength for knights, sense for assassins, agility for archers, and vitality for magicians." he murmurs,  his brow furrowed in thought.
38.30.A.jpg;  "If I have low sense, I'll have a lot of trouble with assassins." he says. 
38.30.B.jpg; The armored figures stand over the fallen comrade, their faces shrouded in shadow.  The air is heavy with the weight of danger.
38.31.A.jpg;  The three swords spin around him,  threatening to strike.  He lies helpless on the ground,  trapped by the blades. 
38.32.A.jpg;  "The longer this goes on, the worse it gets for me." he says. 
38.32.B.jpg; "I'll have to close my eyes for a while and lower my fatigue." he says.
38.32.C.jpg;  He clenches his jaw,  his face contorted in pain.  The blurred background amplifies the feeling of intense struggle.
