1.0.A.jpg;   His knuckles were white, the grip on his sword tight. A faint blue glow emanated from the blade, illuminating the rough rock beneath his hand.  The man's breath hitched as a silent "haah" escaped his lips, his face hidden in the darkness, his struggle evident.
1.0.B.jpg;   The E-Rank Hunter, Sung Jin-Woo, sat amidst the shadows, the red blood staining his face a grotesque mask. Fear and terror twisted his features, his ragged breaths a testament to the ordeal he had endured.
1.1.A.jpg;   A dark brown jacket lay discarded near a pool of blood, revealing the torn blue jeans beneath. The man, lying on the brick floor, his legs marred with deep wounds, moaned softly as a "haah" escaped his lips. 
1.2.A.jpg;   "Lowest rank and weakest hunter," the words echoed in the silent night, their starkness amplified by the menacing figures standing before him.  Sung Jin-Woo’s arms were crossed, his hood pulled tight, his expression a grim mask as he silently absorbed the weight of their judgment.
1.3.A.jpg;   The young man, his face a canvas of blood, stared into the darkness, his eyes wide and bloodshot, reflecting the anguish he felt.  The air crackled with his unspoken pain, each "haah" a ragged gasp for breath.
1.4.A.jpg;   The lines on the man’s chest glowed intensely, pulsating with power as he looked up at the sky, his expression a mix of frustration and determination.  "God-dammit..." he muttered under his breath, the words a testament to the trials he faced.
1.5.A.jpg;   The city of Seoul stretched out before him, a tapestry of bridges and buildings, the blue river snaking its way through the green parklands.  A peaceful scene, a stark contrast to the turmoil he had just left behind. 
1.6.A.jpg;   Sung Jin-Woo hurried across the crosswalk, his pace quickening as he glanced back over his shoulder.  "If you disregard my slightly abnormal strength and regeneration," he mumbled to himself, his worried expression mirroring his inner turmoil, "it's embarrassing to even call myself a hunter."
1.7.A.jpg;   The group walked along the bustling city street, their determined strides a testament to their shared purpose.  "Of course, I'm always getting hurt," the young man, Sung Jin-Woo, said, his voice a low murmur.  "The job where your life's on the line, the hunter... I'm not doing this because I like it."
1.7.B.jpg;   Seoul's construction site buzzed with activity, the air thick with the scent of concrete and sweat.  The cacophony of hammering and machinery filled the air, a constant reminder of the city's relentless growth.
1.8.A.jpg;   "Whoa Whoa," the merchant exclaimed, his voice booming over the marketplace's din.   "I barely pay my sick mother's medical bills with what the Hunter's Guild pays me," Sung Jin-Woo replied, his voice weary.  "For a normal person with no particular talent, I had no choice but to become a hunter."
1.8.B.jpg;   "Here, good luck on your raid today," the man said, handing Sung Jin-Woo a coffee cup.  "Thanks~," Sung Jin-Woo replied, his smile tired but genuine. 
1.9.A.jpg;   "Hey Kim!," a voice called out, breaking the silence of the kitchen.  The two men, their arms crossed, exchanged a silent understanding, their faces a mixture of concern and anticipation.  
1.10.A.jpg;   "It's been a while," the man in orange and black armor said, his voice a low rumble.  Sung Jin-Woo, a grin on his face, waved back, his eyes twinkling with a mix of surprise and delight.  "Wait, Bak! What are you doing here?," he asked, his voice laced with curiosity.
1.10.B.jpg;   "Well, my wife is pregnant with our second son, haha..." Bak said, his smile wide and genuine.  Sung Jin-Woo stared at him, his eyes wide with surprise, "Didn't you leave because you didn't want to become a hunter?" 
1.10.C.jpg;   "True, there's nothing like a raid to earn a fortune," Sung Jin-Woo said, his voice a low murmur, a hint of weariness in his tone.  "It's not easy to live life..." he continued, his gaze fixed on something unseen.
1.11.A.jpg;   Sung Jin-Woo’s brow furrowed, his eyes narrowed with worry.  "I'm worried... It's been so long that I might fall behind," he whispered, his voice barely audible.  "Hoo-" he muttered, the sound of his own apprehension echoing in the silence.
1.11.B.jpg;   "Yo- Sung! You arrived!," a voice called out, a wave of relief washing over Sung Jin-Woo's face.  He grinned, taking a sip from his blue can, "My skill was already bad, and it worsened after I took a break." 
1.12.A.jpg;   "It's cold out there, isn't it? Good job," the man with the hooded sweater said, a warm smile spreading across his face.  "Haha, it's nothing... I'll be in your hands today too," Sung Jin-Woo replied, his smirk a hint of his playful nature.  
1.12.B.jpg;   "Yo, Sung! Sung! You eat yet?," a voice called out, a friendly greeting that brought a smile to Sung Jin-Woo's face.  "Yeah, Mr. Kim Sang-Shik. Thanks for worrying about me," he replied, his tone easy and appreciative.
1.13.A.jpg;   "Hehehe... you wouldn't know since he came right after you quit. His nickname is..." the man in the blue jacket said, a playful glint in his eyes.  The other two men, their faces obscured, seemed to be enjoying the banter, their laughter echoing in the white space.  
1.14.A.jpg;   "The world's weakest," a voice mocked, the words a cruel barb.  Sung Jin-Woo stood his ground, his gaze unwavering, "The world's weakest? Not the strongest?"  He countered, his voice laced with quiet confidence.
1.14.B.jpg;   "I mean, he's weak enough to get hurt in an E-Rank dungeon..." the blue-haired man said, his voice laced with amusement.   The other man, his face etched with worry, asked, "Is he actually the weakest?"
1.14.C.jpg;   "Ah... I see," the blue-haired man said, his voice a hushed whisper.  "So that means our dungeon will be weak as well since he came," he continued, his eyes wide with fear.   "Hey, he might hear us. Let's end it for now, fu fu..." the man with the green jacket said, his voice a chilling murmur.
1.15.A.jpg;   "Hi, may I have a cup of coffee?," Sung Jin-Woo asked, his voice a polite request.  "Ah, Hunter Sung Woo-Jin. I'm sorry, all the coffee ran out just now..." the man behind the counter said, his smile apologetic.  "I've been hearing you, old geezers... ha..." Sung Jin-Woo said, a hint of amusement in his voice.
1.16.A.jpg;   Sung Jin-Woo’s brow furrowed, his face a mask of worry.   "...," a single thought bubble emerged from his head, reflecting the anxieties swirling within him.   "Not even coffee... feels bad, man," he mumbled, his voice tinged with disappointment.
1.17.A.jpg;   "Oh, hi! Looks like Miss Ju-Hee is also attending this raid?," a voice called out, the surprise evident in their tone.  Ju-Hee, her face a picture of shock, replied, "Of course! But that's not the problem! Why is your face hurt again!?"
1.18.A.jpg;   "Dunno... it just happened while I was hunting, haha..." Sung Jin-Woo said, his voice a mix of embarrassment and nonchalance.  Ju-Hee, her eyes narrowed, her expression a mix of concern and disbelief, responded, "Really... what actually happened?"
1.18.B.jpg;   "You even went to a hospital?," the man with the long black hair asked, his voice laced with disbelief.  Sung Jin-Woo, his gaze fixed on the ground, replied, "Yeah..." his voice a quiet confirmation. 
1.18.C.jpg;   "Huh? How could that happen...", the young woman exclaimed, her shock evident in her wide eyes.  Sung Jin-Woo, a mischievous grin on his face, replied, "We were in an E-Rank dungeon and I was the only one hurt." 
1.19.A.jpg;   "The others were all higher ranked so they didn't even bring a healer," the man said, his voice a mix of disappointment and frustration.  Sung Jin-Woo, his face a canvas of weariness, looked at the viewer, his expression a reflection of his inner turmoil.
1.19.B.jpg;   "Even so, they really didn't bring a healer just because they would be safe?," Ju-Hee said, her voice laced with disbelief, her frustration evident in her tone. 
1.20.A.jpg;   "It's okay. It's only because I'm weak..." Sung Jin-Woo said, a forced smile on his face.  "I'm used to it. Miss Ju-Hee also knows that, right?," he asked, his voice a mix of resignation and hope. 
1.20.B.jpg;   "Well, looks like everyone's getting ready to go into the gate. Let's go as well," the woman said, her voice a calm reassurance.  Ju-Hee, her arms crossed, nodded silently, her expression a mix of anticipation and concern. 
1.21.A.jpg;   "We're off to go happy hunting so I'm not really qualified to say this, but," Sung Jin-Woo said, his voice a mixture of excitement and nervousness.   "I'd like to be the party leader for this raid, is that alright with you people?," he asked, his confidence growing with each word.
1.22.A.jpg;   "Mr. Song, you're the highest ranked here! I've got no problems..," one of the men said, his voice filled with respect.  "Well, if it's Mr. Song, we can trust him. It's been a while since I've witnessed his skills..," another man chimed in, his voice laced with a hint of friendly rivalry.
1.22.B.jpg;   "Yeah, I agree as well," Sung Jin-Woo said, his smile wide and genuine.   "Me too," another voice agreed, their enthusiasm palpable.   "Yeah, count me in," a third voice joined in, their camaraderie unmistakable. 
1.22.C.jpg;   "Take care of us, Mr. Song Chi-Yul," the woman said, her voice a heartfelt expression of gratitude.  Sung Jin-Woo, his smile warm and reassuring, looked at her, his eyes filled with a sense of responsibility.  
1.23.A.jpg;   "Alright. Then let's enter the dungeon," Sung Jin-Woo declared, his voice filled with determination.  "Let's go!!!," the others exclaimed, their excitement palpable as they stood before the imposing metal structure.
1.24.A.jpg;   "Mr. Sung, try not to get injured behind us, okay?," the boy said, his voice laced with concern.  Sung Jin-Woo, a smile on his face, replied, "Haha... okay," his confidence a reassuring balm to the boy’s anxiety.
1.24.B.jpg;   "Let's go, Jin-Woo," Sung Jin-Woo said, his voice filled with encouragement.  "Ok, ok..." Jin-Woo replied, his voice tinged with apprehension, as he looked back at the faint figure in the distance.
1.24.C.jpg;   "I'm gonna try my best today!!," Sung Jin-Woo said, his voice filled with determination, his bandage a stark reminder of the trials he had faced.  A guttural sound escaped his lips, a testament to the raw power coursing through his veins.
1.25.A.jpg;   "Wow, Wow, Wow, Wow," Sung Jin-Woo exclaimed, his voice echoing with awe as he stood amidst the ethereal blue-white landscape.  "Wow," he whispered, the word a breathless testament to the wonder he beheld.
2.0.A.jpg;   "All clear! Let's go!," a voice called out, their excitement echoing in the metal chamber.  The large blue circle, swirling with white energy, pulsed with power, casting a mesmerizing glow on the smoke billowing from its center.
2.0.B.jpg;   "What're you thinking about?," the man with the blue jacket asked, his voice a gentle query.  The man with purple hair, his expression a mask of worry, replied, "It's just... Hunter Sung Jin-Woo... I'm a little bothered that we couldn't give him any coffee."
2.1.A.jpg;   "They said it's about D-Rank," the man with blue hair said, his voice a casual confirmation.   Sung Jin-Woo's eyes widened in surprise, his mouth slightly agape as he absorbed the implications of the statement. 
2.2.A.jpg;   "Jin-Woo, why are you so adamant on working as a hunter?," a voice asked, their concern evident in their tone.  Sung Jin-Woo, his hands gripping the bright yellow sphere, responded with a quiet determination, "Fighting like this will only bring even more risks!"
2.3.A.jpg;   "Sorry..." the young woman said, her voice filled with regret, her bright yellow aura a testament to her healing abilities.  The young man, his face etched with worry, replied, "I'm not saying this for an apology! I'm just worried." 
2.4.A.jpg;   A wave of flame erupted, engulfing the male character in a fiery inferno.  The monster, its teeth bared in a silent snarl, lunged forward, its attack met with a defiant as the sword pierced its flesh.
2.4.B.jpg;   The sounds of destruction echoed through the crumbling chamber.  A green figure, his blue sword raised, stood amidst the chaos, his eyes focused on the approaching enemy.
2.5.A.jpg;   "At least this raid is almost over," Ju-Hee said, her voice a quiet sigh, her eyes reflecting a mixture of anticipation and concern.  The forest around them, a blur of green and white, seemed to mirror her unease. 
2.6.A.jpg;   The young woman with black hair, her eyes filled with sadness, stared down, her left eye covered by a patch.   The other woman, her face contorted with anger, glared back, her orange hair a fiery beacon against the green backdrop. 
2.6.B.jpg;   The young man, his green hooded jacket shimmering with an ethereal glow, looked up, his eyes narrowed in concentration.   His determined gaze seemed to pierce through the blurred green background, a testament to his unwavering resolve. 
2.6.C.jpg;   "Looks like it's done!," a voice called out, their confidence echoing in the stone chamber.   "Ha, this is a piece of cake," another voice chimed in, their smugness evident in their tone.  "Mr, Bak, you're not dead yet, huh?," a third voice questioned, their amusement unmistakable.
2.7.A.jpg;   "Jin-woo, do you have a reason," the man with black hair asked, his voice filled with a mixture of surprise and suspicion.  Sung Jin-Woo, his eyes wide, stared ahead, his expression unreadable, the weight of his secret pressing heavy on his chest.
2.8.A.jpg;   "To not quit being a hunter?," the speech bubble asked, its words a stark challenge to the young man.  Sung Jin-Woo, his eyes narrowed in determination, met the challenge head-on, his yellow hair a defiant blaze against the blurred yellow backdrop.
2.8.B.jpg;   "I'm just a hunter for fun. If I don't do this, I might actually die from boredom!," Sung Jin-Woo said, a playful grin on his face.  "Telling her personal reasons will make me even more embarrassed..." he added, a faint blush creeping up his cheeks.
2.8.C.jpg;   "Looks like having "fun" two times will send you raiding in the afterlife," a voice said, their words laced with amusement.  "Pfffft-ack!!," the boy exclaimed, his face contorted with laughter, a green glow radiating from his body. 
2.9.A.jpg;   "Yeah yeah...," the blonde-haired man said, his voice laced with a mixture of confidence and arrogance.   "This is what you get after killing a monster - the magical core," he added, his gaze fixed on the glowing white object in his hand.
2.10.A.jpg;   "A magical core from even a C-Rank monster is worth thousands," the text box said, highlighting the creature's value.  The dragon, its blue scales shimmering in the light, roared, its breath a cloud of white, its sharp claws a menacing threat. 
2.10.B.jpg;   "Considering I put my life on the line," Sung Jin-Woo said, his voice heavy with disappointment.  "After all my injuries and troubles, I only earned a single E-Rank magical core..." he lamented, his expression a mix of weariness and frustration. 
2.11.A.jpg;   "I put my life on the line to earn this, it's too small," Sung Jin-Woo said, his voice laced with bitterness.  "Earning money like this is..." he muttered, his frustration growing.  "Hey! Everyone! There's another entrance here!!," a voice called out, their excitement breaking the tension.
2.12.A.jpg;   The large crack in the mountain yawned open, its depths shrouded in darkness, a silent invitation into the unknown.  The group, their expressions a mixture of curiosity and fear, stood before it, their hearts pounding with a mix of anticipation and dread.
2.12.B.jpg;   "The double lair... looks like it's actually real," the text box said, its words a stark confirmation of the unexpected discovery.  Sung Jin-Woo, his eyes wide with surprise, looked at his companions, his expression a mix of excitement and disbelief. 
2.13.A.jpg;   The creature, its yellow hands radiating blinding light, unleashed a wave of destructive energy, consuming everything in its path.  The man, his body engulfed in orange light, struggled to contain his power, his face contorted with pain. 
2.13.B.jpg;   The vortex, a swirling mass of light, pulsated with an unseen energy, illuminating the rough walls of the cave.  The scene, a testament to the raw power of nature, filled the viewer with a sense of wonder and awe.
2.14.A.jpg;   The figure, shrouded in white light, stood in the center of the cave, her back to the viewer, her presence a beacon of mystery in the darkness.  The faint orange glow from the cave's mouth cast long shadows on the rough walls, amplifying the sense of danger and suspense.
2.14.B.jpg;   "Hmm... Everyone, listen to me for a moment," the man said, his voice a calm request, his orange hair a beacon in the urban setting.  His intense gaze, focused on something unseen, hinted at the weight of his decision.
2.16.A.jpg;   "Since the gate is still open, it seems the boss is inside there," Sung Jin-Woo said, his voice calm and measured.  "Usually, we'd need to contact our guild and await their orders, but..." he continued, a glint of excitement in his eyes. 
2.16.B.jpg;   The tension in the air was palpable, the silence a deafening echo of the unspoken conflict.   The four characters, their expressions a mixture of anger, concern, and determination, were locked in a silent battle of wills. 
2.16.C.jpg;   "If the other hunters get to it first, our profits would dwindle," the man said, his voice trembling with fear.  His eyes, wide and panicked, reflected the anxiety that gnawed at his heart. 
2.17.A.jpg;   "So I wish for all of us to go kill the boss," Sung Jin-Woo said, his voice filled with determination, his hand on his chin as he pondered the implications of his statement. 
2.17.B.jpg;   "Since it could be dangerous, why don't 17 of us take a vote?," the man with black hair suggested, his voice calm and measured.  The other characters, their expressions a mix of seriousness and apprehension, listened intently, their gazes fixed on the man. 
2.18.A.jpg;   "And no complaining after the vote results," Sung Jin-Woo said, his voice a stern warning, his troubled expression a reflection of the weight he carried.  He stood on the mountain, his right arm outstretched, a gesture of power and command.
2.18.B.jpg;   "Nah," one voice said, their dissent clear and unwavering.  "I vote to go," another voice countered, their determination evident.  "I say no," a third voice chimed in, their opposition adding to the tension.  "We vote to fight," Sung Jin-Woo declared, his voice a firm statement of intent. 
2.19.A.jpg;   "It's 8:8 so far, huh?," the man asked, his voice a mix of surprise and anticipation, his smile wide and genuine.  Ju-Hee, her orange hair shimmering in the light, looked down at him, her expression a mixture of worry and concern. 
2.19.B.jpg;   "How about Mr. Sung?," the man asked, his voice a quiet query, his eyes reflecting his concern.  Sung Jin-Woo, his face a mask of weariness, met his gaze, his expression unreadable, his silence a powerful statement. 
2.20.A.jpg;   Sung Jin-Woo's fist clenched, his knuckles white, the light emanating from his fingers a reflection of the turmoil within.  "Soon, I even need to send my little sister to college..." he muttered, his voice heavy with despair.  "I don't have enough money..." he whispered, his frustration reaching a fever pitch.
2.20.B.jpg;   The woman lay on the hospital bed, her eyes closed, her face pale, a silent testament to the pain she endured.  "My sick mother..." she thought, her voice a whisper, her heart heavy with worry.  "For my family!," she added, her resolve unwavering, her love for her family her driving force. 
2.21.A.jpg;   "I'm going!," Sung Jin-Woo roared, his voice echoing in the battlefield, his anger a powerful force.  His blue jacket billowed in the wind, his right arm raised in a defiant gesture, his eyes burning with a fierce determination.
