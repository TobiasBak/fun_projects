1.0.A.jpg;  "My name is Sung Jin-Woo," he muttered, his voice raspy with pain. A blue and white blade, imbued with power, materialized in the shadows, a silent threat in the darkness.
1.0.B.jpg;  The young man, covered in blood, lay sprawled on the cold, dirty floor of a dark alleyway.  His eyes were wild with pain, but a cruel grin twisted his lips, a menacing gaze beneath the shadow of his dark blue hoodie.
1.1.A.jpg;  A man, his clothes splattered with blood, lay on the harsh concrete.  He stared at the crimson pool spreading beneath him, his face contorted in pain and shock, a single word, "haah," escaping his lips.
1.2.A.jpg;  He sat, expressionless, in the center of a barren room, his hands resting on his lap.  "I never expected this to happen to me..." he whispered, his voice a mere murmur against the looming presence of the shadow figure behind him. 
1.3.A.jpg;  Tears streamed down his face, blurring his vision.  His chest heaved with each ragged breath, "haah" escaping his lips in a pained whisper.
1.4.A.jpg;  The character's face, contorted in a wide, menacing grin, was obscured by lines of black, creating a terrifying aura.  "God-dammit..." he snarled, his voice filled with anger, his blue aura crackling with violent energy. 
1.4.B.jpg;   The Korean word "무," meaning "nothingness" or "emptiness," loomed large against the black backdrop, its bold, heavy strokes radiating a powerful, even violent energy. 
1.5.A.jpg;  Seoul, South Korea.  A tranquil scene of a city nestled along a river, a winding road leading to a bridge connecting the two sides.  
1.6.A.jpg;  Standing in the middle of the crosswalk, surrounded by oblivious passersby, the young man felt a wave of shame wash over him.  "If you disregard my slightly abnormal strength and regeneration, it's embarrassing to even call myself a hunter," he muttered, his voice barely a whisper. 
1.7.A.jpg;  "Of course, I'm always getting hurt and even had a lot of near-death experiences," the woman sighed, her voice weary.  "The job where your life's on the line, the hunter... I'm not doing this because I like it."
1.7.B.jpg;   A construction site in Seoul, a testament to the hard work and dedication of the workers, bustled with activity.  A cloud of blue smoke rose from the site, obscuring the workers in its mist.
1.8.A.jpg;  Standing on the blue and white truck, the man smirked, his eyes meeting the viewer's.  "I barely pay my sick mother's medical bills with what the hunter's guild pays me," he said, his voice filled with a quiet melancholy.
1.8.B.jpg;  "Thanks," the blue-haired man said, his voice casual, as he accepted the blue cap with a green logo.  "Here, good luck on your raid today."
1.9.A.jpg;  "Hey- Kim!" the man called out, his voice tinged with worry as he held a can in front of a white plume of smoke.  The other man, with his back turned, seemed oblivious to the tension in the air.
1.10.A.jpg;  "It's been a while," the man said with a bright smile, waving to the figure on the left.  "Wait, Bak! What are you doing here?" a surprised voice called from the right.
1.10.B.jpg;  "Didn't you leave because you didn't want to become a hunter?" the man in the blue jacket asked, raising a blue cup.  The other man laughed, his face beaming.  "Well, my wife is pregnant with our second son, haha..."
1.10.C.jpg;  "It's not easy to live life..." the man said, his voice tinged with a realistic cynicism.  "True, there's nothing like a raid to earn a fortune."
1.11.A.jpg;  "I'm worried... it's been so long that I might fall behind," the man muttered, his face drawn in worry, his eyes closed.
1.11.B.jpg;  "Yo- Sung! You arrived!" the young man said, his voice filled with warmth, a glass of liquid in his hand.  "Sung, thanks for coming," the other man replied, a friendly smile on his face.
1.12.A.jpg;  "It's cold out there, isn't it?  Good job," the man in the green jacket said, his voice strained.  "Haha, it's nothing... I'll be in your hands today too," the man in the black jacket replied, his voice confident, his eyes closed.
1.12.B.jpg;  "Yo, Sung! Sung! You eat yet?" the blue-haired man called out, his voice filled with joy.  "Yeah, Mr. Kim Sang-shik.  Thanks for worrying about me," the man with the green jacket replied, his smile warm. 
1.13.A.jpg;   "Hehehe... you wouldn't know since he came right after you quit.  His nickname is..." the man said, his voice laced with amusement, his smile wide.  The other man's eyes widened in shock.
1.14.A.jpg;  "The world's weakest," the man said, his voice filled with a mixture of sadness and confusion.  "Not the strongest?" he muttered, a thought bubble appearing above his head.
1.14.B.jpg;  "I mean, he's weak enough to get hurt in an E-Rank dungeon..." the man said, his voice filled with a mixture of amusement and surprise.  "Is he actually the weakest?" the other man asked, his eyes wide.
1.14.C.jpg;  The blue-haired man stood frozen, his eyes closed, his brow furrowed.  "Hey, he might hear us.  Let's end it for now, fu fu..." one voice whispered, his voice laced with a mischievous tone.  "Ah... I see..." another voice agreed, his voice a low murmur.
1.15.A.jpg;  "I've been hearing you, old geezers... ha..." the man in the blue jacket said, a smirk playing on his lips.  "Hi, may I have a cup of coffee?" the man in the green and blue jacket asked, his voice polite. 
1.16.A.jpg;  The young man stood with his back to the camera, his face contorted in confusion.  "Not even coffee... feels bad, man," he muttered, his voice filled with a deep sense of despair.
1.17.A.jpg;  "Oh, hi!  Looks like Miss Ju-hee is also attending this raid?" a surprised voice asked.  "Of course!  But that's not the problem!  Why is your face hurt again!?" the woman exclaimed, her voice filled with worry.
1.18.A.jpg;  The young woman stared at the boy in disbelief, her mouth agape.  "Dunno... it just happened while I was hunting, haha..." he said, his voice carefree, his smile wide.
1.18.B.jpg;  "You even went to a hospital," the woman said, her voice filled with concern.  "Yeah," the man replied, his voice a mere whisper.
1.18.C.jpg;  "Huh? How could that happen..." the woman exclaimed, her eyes wide in disbelief.  "We were in an E-Rank dungeon and I was the only one hurt..." the man explained, his voice calm, his expression neutral.
1.19.A.jpg;  "The others were all higher ranked so they didn't even bring a healer," a voice whispered, his tone filled with sadness.  The man with the green eyes stood slumped, his gaze fixed on the ground.
1.19.B.jpg;  "Even so, they really didn't bring a healer just because they would be safe?" the woman exclaimed, her voice filled with a mixture of shock and concern.
1.20.A.jpg;  "It's okay.  It's only because I'm weak... I'm used to it.  Miss Ju-hee also knows that, right?" the man said, his voice confident, his smile bright.
1.20.B.jpg;   "Ok.." the man said, his voice a simple acknowledgement.  "Well, looks like everyone's getting ready to go into the gate.  Let's go as well," the woman with the reddish-brown hair said, her voice filled with excitement. 
1.21.A.jpg;   "We're off to go happy hunting so I'm not really qualified to say this, but," the man in the blue jacket said, his voice calm, his expression serious.
1.22.A.jpg;   "Mr. Song, you're the highest ranked here! I've got no problems," the man in the blue jacket said, his voice filled with confidence.  "Well, if it's Mr. Song, we can trust him. It's been a while since I've witnessed his skills," the man in the green jacket agreed, his voice filled with admiration.
1.22.B.jpg;   "Yeah, agree as well," the man with black hair said, his voice calm.  "Me too~," the woman with blue hair agreed, her smile wide.
1.22.C.jpg;  "Take care of us, Mr. Song Chi-yul," the girl said, her voice filled with a mixture of warmth and melancholy. 
1.23.A.jpg;  "Alright, then let's enter the dungeon," the man with the black beanie said, his voice filled with a mix of excitement and trepidation.  "Let's go!!!" someone shouted, their voice filled with a bold confidence.
1.24.A.jpg;   "Mr. Sung, try not to get injured behind us, okay?" the man in the blue hoodie said, his voice lighthearted, his smile genuine.  "Haha... okay," the man in the blue jacket replied, his smile mirroring the other man's. 
1.24.B.jpg;   "Let's go, Jin-Woo," the boy with the dark blue hair said, his voice filled with urgency.  "Ok, ok..." the girl with the long pink hair replied, her voice a soft murmur.
1.24.C.jpg;   "I'm gonna try my best today!!" the man with the blue hair said, his voice filled with a fierce determination.  "Huh-!" he exclaimed, a tear-shaped exclamation point appearing above his head.
1.25.A.jpg;   The man with the black hair walked away, his blue glow making him appear as if he were moving through water.  "A a a a" the text on the screen whispered, adding to the feeling of urgency.
1.25.B.jpg;   "나 혼자만 레벨업," the title card announced, the text glowing with a vibrant energy,  "Only I level up" it translated, the words hinting at a new beginning, a new journey. 
2.0.A.jpg;   "All clear!  Let's go!" the voice called out, excitement tinged with relief.  "Ah, ok," another voice replied, a sense of shared relief washing over the group.
2.0.B.jpg;   "It's just... Hunter Sung Jin-Woo... I'm a little bothered that we couldn't give him any coffee," the man said, his brow furrowed in concern.  "What're you thinking about?" the other man asked, his voice laced with amusement.
2.1.A.jpg;   The young man's eyes widened in shock, his jaw dropping.  "They said it's about D-Rank," he whispered, his voice filled with disbelief.  "I've never seen Hunter Sung Jin-Woo uninjured in my whole time at the Hunter's Guild," he added, his voice filled with awe. 
2.2.A.jpg;   The man reached out towards the glowing orb, his fingers spread wide.  "Jin-Woo, why are you so adamant on working as a hunter?" a voice asked, concern lacing their tone.  "Fighting like this will only bring even more risks!" another voice cried out, their words echoing with a sense of urgency.
2.3.A.jpg;   "Sorry..." the young man said, his voice filled with regret.  "I'm not saying this for an apology!  I'm just worried," the woman replied, her voice laced with concern, her hand outstretched towards him, a green light pulsing between their fingertips.
2.4.A.jpg;   "화르륵," the text whispered, a wave of fire erupting from the young man's hand as he unleashed a fiery blast.   "휙," the text hissed, as the blue dragon blocked the attack, a fierce clash of magic filling the air.
2.4.B.jpg;   The large hall, its ceiling cracked and crumbling, echoed with the clash of steel.  A cloud of light blue energy swirled in the air, its tendrils reaching out like grasping claws.  "Kwang" and "Kwong" the text boomed,  a fierce battle erupting amidst the chaos.
2.5.A.jpg;   "At least this raid is almost over," the woman said, her voice laced with a hint of annoyance.  Her gaze, however, was fixed on the distant horizon, a glimmer of excitement in her eyes.
2.6.A.jpg;   The girl stared at the boy, her gaze intense.  A series of green crosses floated in the air around them, their presence adding to the sense of confusion and uncertainty that permeated the scene.
2.6.B.jpg;   The character, his face obscured by a soft white glow, stared down, his expression serious, his focus unwavering.  
2.6.C.jpg;    "Looks like it's done!" the man in the armor exclaimed, his voice filled with exhilaration.  "Mr. Bak, you're not dead yet, huh?" another man asked, his voice tinged with amusement.
2.7.A.jpg;   "Jin-Woo, do you have a reason..." the voice asked, a hint of curiosity in their tone.  The young man, his body bathed in a bright yellow light, looked off screen, his expression unreadable.
2.8.A.jpg;   "To not quit being a hunter?" the girl asked, her voice laced with a mixture of fear and determination.  The scene, filled with tension and suspense, was a visual representation of her inner turmoil.
2.8.B.jpg;    "I'm just a hunter for fun. If I don't do this, I might actually die from boredom!" the man in the green jacket said, his smile wide and genuine.
2.8.C.jpg;   "Looks like having "fun" two times will send you raiding in the afterlife," the girl said, her voice filled with a mix of amusement and concern.  "Pfffft - ack!!" the man exclaimed, a look of surprise and shock on his face. 
2.9.A.jpg;   "This is what you get after killing a monster - the magical core," the young man said, his voice filled with excitement.  "Yeah yeah..." another voice said, their tone laced with indifference.
2.10.A.jpg;   "A magical core from even a C-Rank monster is worth thousands," a voice said, their words filled with a sense of awe.  "However, since Jin-Woo was an E-Rank hunter, C-Rank monsters were impossible for him," another voice added, a hint of sadness in their tone.
2.10.B.jpg;   "After all my injuries and troubles, I only earned a single E-Rank magical core..." the man said, his voice filled with a mixture of disappointment and resignation.  "Considering I put my life on the line..." he muttered, his gaze fixed on the glowing crystal in his hand.
2.11.A.jpg;   "Earning money like this is..." the man in the black and grey jacket said, his voice filled with shock.  "Hey!  Everyone!  There's another entrance here!!" another man called out, his voice filled with excitement.
2.12.A.jpg;   "Hello," the text whispered, the group of men staring into the dark cave, their expressions filled with a mixture of awe and fear. 
2.12.B.jpg;   "The double lair... looks like it's actually real," the man with the red hair said, his voice filled with excitement.  "The man with the dark blue hair stared up at the sky, his expression a mixture of surprise and amazement.
2.13.A.jpg;   The man with the brown hair stood, his shoulders tense, his fist clenched,  glowing lines of light swirling around him.  The scene radiated an intense energy, promising a powerful display of magic.
2.13.B.jpg;   The cavern, its walls cracked and uneven, was illuminated by the bright yellow glow of the portal, its energy pulsating with an ominous energy.  
2.14.A.jpg;   "Hello," the text whispered, a female figure standing bathed in a white light, her form obscured by the blinding glow.  The scene radiated a sense of mystery and intrigue. 
2.14.B.jpg;   "Hmm... everyone, listen to me for a moment," the man with the orange hair said, his voice filled with a sense of urgency.  His brow furrowed, his eyes narrowed, as if weighing the gravity of the situation.
2.16.A.jpg;    "Since the gate is still open, it seems the boss is inside there," a voice said, his voice filled with a mixture of excitement and anticipation.  "Usually, we'd need to contact our guild and await their orders, but..." another voice said, his voice filled with a sense of urgency. 
2.16.B.jpg;    The group of characters stood, their expressions a mixture of confusion and worry.  "The man in the green jacket had a dark mark on his forehead, while the man in the black jacket had a scar over his left eye.  A golden circle with a sword in it floated in the middle of the panel, its presence adding to the feeling of uncertainty and danger.
2.16.C.jpg;   "If the other hunters get to it first, our profits would dwindle," the man with the orange hair said, his voice laced with a hint of desperation.  His smile, wide and exaggerated, suggested that he was feeling pressured and anxious.
2.17.A.jpg;  "So I wish for all of us to go kill the boss..." the man said, his voice unwavering, his gaze fixed on the distant horizon. 
2.17.B.jpg;   The group of characters stood in the dark room, their faces illuminated by a faint glow.  "Since it could be dangerous, why don't 17 of us take a vote?" one voice suggested, their voice laced with a sense of urgency.
2.18.A.jpg;   "And no complaining after the vote results," the man said, his voice stern, his expression serious.  His body, suspended in the air, seemed to radiate a sense of power and authority. 
2.18.B.jpg;    "We vote to fight," the large white circle proclaimed, its text echoing the sentiment of the man in the blue jacket.  "Nah," the man in the green jacket muttered, his voice laced with a hint of reluctance.
2.19.A.jpg;   "It's 8:8 so far, huh?" the man with the orange hair said, his voice a mixture of curiosity and amusement.  The woman with the orange hair stood silently, her expression troubled, a hint of worry in her eyes.
2.19.B.jpg;   "How about Mr. Sung?" the voice asked, a note of concern in their tone. The man with the black hair and the band-aids on his face looked down, his expression filled with a mixture of sadness and fear.
2.20.A.jpg;   "I don't have enough money..." the man thought, his fist clenched tightly.  "Soon, I even need to send my little sister to college..." he added, a sense of desperation and anxiety filling his thoughts. 
2.20.B.jpg;    "And... my sick mother... for my family!" the man's voice echoed, his hand reaching out to the sick woman lying in the hospital bed, a powerful testament to his love and devotion.
2.21.A.jpg;   "I'm going!" the man shouted, his voice filled with determination.  His expression was a mix of anger and excitement, his eyes burning with a fierce resolve.
2.21.B.jpg;    "Just one more time! Let's do this!" the text in the speech bubble declared, a sense of anticipation and excitement filling the air.   "나 혼자만 레벨업," the title card proclaimed, the words echoing the character's unique power and determination.
