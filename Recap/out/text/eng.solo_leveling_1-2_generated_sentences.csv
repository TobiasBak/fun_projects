1.0.A.jpg;            His hand trembled, a crimson stain marring his blue shirt as he gripped the sword lying half-buried in the dirt. "My Name Is Sung Jin-Woo." the words echoed in his head, a stark reminder of his situation.
1.0.B.jpg;           Clutching his bleeding wounds, the young man struggled to rise from the cold floor. Despite the pain etched across his face, Sung Jin-Woo's eyes burned with determination.
1.1.A.jpg;            His left leg throbbed with pain, the ripped fabric of his pants offering a stark reminder of the battle he'd endured. He clung to the sword, the familiar weight a small comfort in the desolate surroundings.
1.2.A.jpg;            He stared at the towering monsters, their blue armor gleaming ominously under the dim light. "Lowest Rank And Weakest Hunter." the words stung, a cruel reminder of his insignificance in the face of such power.
1.3.A.jpg;            His bloodshot eyes darted around, searching for a way out, a glimmer of hope in the suffocating darkness. "Haah." the rasping sound escaped his lips, a testament to the fear gnawing at his soul.
1.4.A.jpg;            He roared in anger, his sword flashing as it connected with the monster, sending it crashing to the ground. "God-Damn it." he muttered. 
1.5.A.jpg;            From above, the sprawling city stretched out before him, a tapestry of buildings and waterways bathed in the warm glow of the setting sun. "Seoul, South Korea." the name felt strangely distant, a world away from the chaos he had just escaped.
1.6.A.jpg;            The city street was a blur of movement and noise, but he walked on, his gaze fixed ahead.  "It's embarrassing to even call myself a hunter." his voice was barely a whisper, filled with a deep-seated shame.
1.7.A.jpg;            The bustling city streets were a stark contrast to the quiet desperation in their hearts. "The Job Where Your Life's On The Line, The Hunter... I'm Not Doing This Because I Like It." his words were a lament, a cry of frustration against a fate he couldn't escape. 
1.7.B.jpg;            The construction site thrummed with activity, a symphony of clanging metal and shouting workers. "A construction site in Seoul." the words felt mundane compared to the chaos swirling within him. 
1.8.A.jpg;            The man in the green jacket stood with a heavy heart, his hand resting on his chest. "I Barely Pay My Sick Mother's Medical Bills With What The Hunter's Guild Pays Me." he thought. "For A Normal Person With No Particular Talent, I Had No Choice But To Become A Hunter."  a grim acceptance settled in his eyes.
1.8.B.jpg;            The man with blue hair looked up at his friend, his face etched with concern. "Here, Good Luck On Your Raid Today." he said, offering a warm smile and a cup of something hot. "Thanks." the man with brown hair responded, a flicker of determination in his eyes.
1.9.A.jpg;            The man with black hair blinked in surprise, startled by the sudden address. "Hey Kim!" the voice called out,  a familiar tone that sent a rush of warmth through him.
1.10.A.jpg;            The man in the green jacket beamed, his hand waving excitedly in the air. "It's Been A While." his voice filled with joy.  "Wait, Bak! What Are You Doing Here?"  he asked, a hint of disbelief in his tone.
1.10.B.jpg;            The man in the blue jacket shook hands with the other man, relief washing over his face. "Didn't You Leave Because You Didn't Want To Become A Hunter?" he asked, a hint of amusement in his voice. "Well, My Wife Is Pregnant With Our Second Son, Haha." the man in the green jacket chuckled, his eyes sparkling with happiness.
1.10.C.jpg;            The man with blue hair leaned back, his eyes distant as he pondered life's complexities. "True, There's Nothing Like A Raid To Earn A Fortune." he mused, "It's Not Easy To Live Life." 
1.11.A.jpg;            He paced back and forth, his brow furrowed with worry. "I'm Worried... It's Been So Long That I Might Fall Behind." his inner monologue echoed, each word a sharp reminder of his dwindling skills. 
1.11.B.jpg;            The man with green hair turned to face his friend, a wave of relief washing over him. "My Skill Was Already Bad, And It Worsened After I Took A Break." he confessed, a hint of shame in his voice. "Yo- Sung! You Arrived!" the man with blue hair exclaimed. "Sung, Thanks For Coming."  he added, his smile genuine and welcoming.
1.12.A.jpg;            The man with black hair laughed, his eyes sparkling with camaraderie. "Haha, It's Nothing.... I'll Be In Your Hands Today Too." he said, a playful glint in his eye.
1.12.B.jpg;            The man with black hair smiled, basking in the warmth of the conversation.  "Yo, Sung! Sung! You eat yet?" the man with grey hair asked. "Yeah, Mr. Kim Sang-shik. Thanks for worrying about me." the man replied. 
1.13.A.jpg;            The man with black hair flinched, a wave of apprehension washing over him.  "Hehe... You wouldn't know since he came right after you quit. His nickname is...." the man with the goatee chuckled, a mischievous glint in his eyes. The man with black hair's face paled, a sense of dread settling in his gut.
1.14.A.jpg;            He stood amidst the chaos of the construction site, his gaze troubled. "The World's Weakest." the words echoed in his mind, a cruel mockery of his S-Rank status. "The World's Weakest? Not the strongest?" he muttered, a mixture of confusion and anger swirling within him.
1.14.B.jpg;            The man with blue hair chuckled, his eyes twinkling with amusement. "I mean, he's weak enough to get hurt in a E-rank dungeon...." he said, taking a sip from his blue cup. "Yeah, he's probably the weakest of us all." the man with brown hair agreed.
1.14.C.jpg;            He stood there, his face a mask of worry, his shoulders slumped with defeat. "So that means our dungeon will be weak as well since he came." one of the men behind him muttered, a hint of disappointment in his voice. "Ah... I see." the other man agreed, his tone devoid of empathy.
1.15.A.jpg;            He stood behind the counter, his expression downcast. "I've been hearing you, old geezer... Ha." the man in blue said, a playful smile on his face. "Hi, may I have a cup of coffee?" he asked politely.  "Ah, Hunter Sung Woo-jin. I'm sorry, all the coffee ran out just now." the man behind the counter replied. 
1.16.A.jpg;            He slumped against the counter, his heart heavy with disappointment. "Not even coffee... Feels bad, man." he mumbled, a single tear threatening to escape his eye. 
1.17.A.jpg;            The woman with orange hair gasped, her eyes widening in surprise.  "Oh, hi! Looks like Miss Ju-hee is also attending this raid?" she exclaimed. "Of course! But that's not the problem! Why is your face hurt again!?"  she exclaimed. 
1.18.A.jpg;            The man with black hair smiled, his eyes sparkling with mischief. "Really... What Actually Happened?"  the girl with long brown hair asked. 
1.18.B.jpg;            The woman with brown hair raised an eyebrow, her gaze fixed on the man with black hair.  "You Even Went To A Hospital?" she asked, a hint of disbelief in her voice. "Yeah." he replied.
1.18.C.jpg;            The woman with long brown hair stared at the man, her face a picture of confusion. "Huh? How Could That Happen..." she exclaimed. "We Were In A E-Rank Dungeon And I Was The Only One Hurt." he said, a wry smile playing on his lips. 
1.19.A.jpg;            He stood there, his bandaged cheek throbbing with pain, a wave of frustration washing over him. "The Others Were All Higher Ranked So They Didn't Even Bring A Healer." he thought,  a sense of injustice weighing heavily on his heart. 
1.19.B.jpg;            She watched, her anger simmering beneath the surface. "Even So, They Really Didn't Bring A Healer Just Because They Would Be Safe?"  she thought.
1.20.A.jpg;            He shrugged, a smug smile playing on his lips.  "It's Okay, It's Only Because I'm Weak." he muttered. "I'm Used To It, Miss Ju-Hee Also Knows That, Right?" he added, his eyes twinkling with a touch of mischief. 
1.20.B.jpg;            She leaned back on the wooden bench, a sense of calm settling over her. "Well, Looks Like Everyone's Getting Ready To Go Into The Gate. Let's Go As Well." she said. "Ok." he replied.
1.21.A.jpg;            He beamed, his eyes sparkling with excitement. "Every-One! We're Off To Go Happy Hunting So I'm Not Really Qualified To Say This, But." he announced. "I'd Like To Be The Party Leader For This Raid, Is That Alright With You People?" he asked.
1.22.A.jpg;            The man in the middle chuckled, his smile widening. "Mr. Song, You're The Highest Ranked Here! I've Got No Problems." he said.  "Well, If It's Mr. Song, We Can Trust Him. It's Been A While Since I've Witnessed His Skills." the man on the right agreed, his eyes gleaming with admiration. 
1.22.B.jpg;            The man with black hair grinned, a sense of camaraderie washing over him.  "Yeah, I Agree As Well." he said. "Me Too." the woman with blue hair echoed, her smile as bright as the sun. "Yeah, Count Me In."  the man on the left added.
1.22.C.jpg;            He smiled, his eyes filled with warmth and gratitude.  "Take care of us, Mr. Song Chi-yul." the woman with orange hair said.
1.23.A.jpg;            A sense of anticipation hung in the air, a palpable wave of excitement washing over them. "Alright, Then Let's Enter The Dungeon." one of them exclaimed, their voice filled with a mixture of eagerness and trepidation. "Let's Go!!!" they all shouted in unison, their voices echoing through the construction site. 
1.24.A.jpg;            The man with brown hair chuckled, his eyes twinkling with amusement. "Mr. Sung, Try Not To Get Injured Behind Us, Okay?"  he said.  "Haha... Okay." the man with black hair replied, his smile a mixture of embarrassment and amusement. 
1.24.B.jpg;            He stood there. a flicker of sadness in his eyes. "Ok, Ok..." he said, his gaze drawn to the woman disappearing into the blue smoke. "Let's go, Jin-woo."  the words hung in the air, a reminder of the journey they were about to undertake.
1.24.C.jpg;            He took a deep breath, his gaze unwavering.  "I'm gonna try my best today!!" he declared, a spark of determination in his eyes. The blue and white background seemed to swirl around him, mirroring the intensity of his resolve.
1.25.A.jpg;            He stepped forward, his heart filled with a mix of hope and trepidation. The blue energy swirled around him, a shimmering halo of light guiding his path.  He walked towards the light, a sense of purpose fueling his steps.
2.0.A.jpg;            They stood there, their faces etched with surprise and shock, as the blue energy swirled around them.  "Ah, Ok." one of them exclaimed.  "All clear! Let's go!"  they all shouted in unison, their voices echoing through the snowy expanse.
2.0.B.jpg;            The man in the blue jacket looked down, his brow furrowed with worry. "What're you thinking about?" the man with brown hair asked. "It's just... Hunter Sung Jin-woo... I'm a little bothered that we couldn't give him any coffee."  he said.
2.1.A.jpg;            He stared at the swirling blue energy, his mouth agape in disbelief. "They said it's about D-rank." he muttered.  "I've never seen Hunter Sung Jin-woo uninjured in my whole time at the Hunter's Guild."  he said.
2.2.A.jpg;            The hands pressed against the glowing sphere, their grip firm and unwavering. "Jin-Woo, why are you so adamant on working as a hunter?"  the words echoed in his mind, a challenge to his unwavering resolve.  "Fighting like this will only bring even more risks!" the words felt like a warning, a reminder of the dangers that lay ahead. 
2.3.A.jpg;            He sat there, his face a picture of concern, his gaze fixed on the woman.  "Sorry...." he mumbled. "I'm not saying this for an apology! I'm just worried."  she said. her hands glowing with a gentle warmth.
2.4.A.jpg;            The woman's eyes narrowed, her gaze fixed on the creature that stood before them. In the next panel, the man with brown hair unleashed a wave of yellow-orange energy, his hand outstretched in a gesture of defiance.  The man with black hair charged forward, his sword raised high, his face set in a determined expression.
2.4.B.jpg;            The room echoed with the clash of steel and the roar of the creature, a cacophony of sound and fury. The woman with the shield stood firm, her gaze unwavering as she faced the creature's onslaught. The man with the sword fought with a ferocity born of desperation, his every move fueled by a need to protect those around him. 
2.5.A.jpg;            She sighed, a flicker of relief washing over her.  "At least this raid is almost over." she thought, her eyes gazing towards the distant horizon. 
2.6.A.jpg;            He stood there, his gaze fixed on the woman with orange hair, a sense of concern etched across his face.  She returned his gaze, her eyes filled with worry, her brow furrowed in thought.
2.6.B.jpg;            He stood there, enveloped in a green glow, his head slightly tilted, his eyes narrowed in anticipation. The fog swirled around him, a ghostly veil obscuring the world beyond. 
2.6.C.jpg;            "Mr. Bak, You're Not Dead Yet, Huh?" the man with the blue jacket chuckled. "Ha, This Is A Piece Of Cake." the man with the green jacket replied, a smug grin spreading across his face. "Looks Like It's Done!" the man with orange hair exclaimed.
2.7.A.jpg;            He stood there, his face a mask of anger and suspicion, his eyes narrowed into slits. "Jin-Woo, Do You Have A Reason..." he growled.
2.8.A.jpg;            She stood there, her blonde hair flowing in the wind.  "To Not Quit Being A Hunter?" she shouted, her eyes blazing with a fierce resolve. 
2.8.B.jpg;            He smiled, his eyes wide with a mischievous glint. "I'm Just A Hunter For Fun. If I Don't Do This, I Might Actually Die From Boredom!"  he exclaimed. "Telling Her Personal Reasons Will Make Me Even More Embarrassed." he thought, a blush creeping onto his cheeks. 
2.8.C.jpg;            The woman with blonde hair burst into laughter, her grin widening with every chuckle. "Don't Laugh!! You'll Open Up." she said. "Looks Like Having "Fun" Two Times Will Send You Raiding In The Afterlife." she added, her eyes sparkling with amusement.
2.9.A.jpg;            He held up the glowing object, a triumphant smile on his face.  "This Is What You Get After Killing A Monster - The Magical Core." he explained. "Yeah Yeah." the other man mumbled, his gaze fixed on the object, his eyes gleaming with greed.
2.10.A.jpg;            The cartoon dragon sat perched on the branch, a halo hovering above its head. "A Magical Core From Even A C-Rank Monster Is Worth Thousands." the text explained, highlighting the value of the treasure.  "However, Since Jin-Woo Was An E-Rank Hunter, C-Rank Monsters Were Impossible For Him." the text continued, explaining the reason for Jin-Woo's lack of such valuable loot. 
2.10.B.jpg;            He held the yellow object in his hand, his face a mask of disappointment. "After All My Injuries And Troubles, I Only Earned A Single E-Rank Magical Core...." he thought, a wave of frustration washing over him. "Considering I Put My Life On The Line To Kill." he muttered.
2.11.A.jpg;            The man with black hair slumped against the wall, his shoulders slumped with defeat.  "Hey! Everyone! There's another entrance here!!" the man with the brown jacket exclaimed. 
2.12.A.jpg;            They stood there, their faces etched with concern, their eyes fixed on the gaping black hole.  The woman with blonde hair, her pink hat a bright spot in the otherwise dreary landscape,  looked on with a mixture of fear and curiosity.
2.12.B.jpg;            The man with orange hair grinned, his eyes sparkling with excitement. "The double lair... looks like it's actually real." he said.  The man with black hair looked on, his face a picture of worry, a sense of unease settling over him. 
2.13.A.jpg;            He stood there, his face set in a determined expression, his hand glowing with a brilliant orange light.  The air crackled with energy, anticipation building as he prepared to unleash his power.
2.13.B.jpg;            The light surged upward, a wave of intense energy erupting from the ground,  a blinding flash of yellow illuminating the surrounding rock formations. The trail of glowing light seemed to pulsate with power, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.
2.14.A.jpg;            The tunnel stretched out before them, its rough walls lit by the glow of the unknown figure at the end.  The air was thick with a sense of mystery, anticipation hanging heavy in the air. 
2.14.B.jpg;            He stood there, his brow furrowed with concern. "Hmm... everyone, listen to me for a moment." he said, his gaze sweeping over the group, his eyes searching for a solution. 
2.16.A.jpg;            He stood there, his smile confident, his gaze fixed on the group of men behind him. "Since the gate is still open, it seems the boss is inside there." he said. "Usually, we'd need to contact our guild and await their orders, but..."  he paused, his eyes scanning their faces, searching for any signs of dissent.
2.16.B.jpg;            The man with grey hair glared at the man with black hair, his face a mask of frustration and anger. The woman with pink hair looked on with a mixture of concern and apprehension, her eyes wide with worry.  The woman with black hair  shared the same sense of unease, her expression mirroring the anxiety that hung in the air.  
2.16.C.jpg;            He stood there, his eyes wide with worry, his mouth agape in shock. "If The Other Hunters Get To It First, Our Profits Would Dwindle." he thought, a sense of anxiety gnawing at him.
2.17.A.jpg;            He stood there, his face a mask of seriousness, his brow furrowed in concentration. "So I wish for all of us to go kill the boss." he said. his eyes fixed on a point beyond the horizon.
2.17.B.jpg;            The man with black hair nodded, his expression serious. "Since it could be dangerous, why don't 17 of us take a vote?" he suggested.  The woman with blue hair looked on with a mixture of concern and apprehension, her eyes wide with worry.  The woman with pink hair shared the same sense of unease, her expression mirroring the anxiety that hung in the air.
2.18.A.jpg;            He stood there, his face stern, his gaze unwavering. "And no complaining after the vote results." he said. leaving no room for argument.
2.18.B.jpg;            The man with green jacket grinned, a mischievous glint in his eyes. "We vote to fight." he said. "Nah." the man with grey hair replied, his expression amused. "I vote to go." the man with green jacket insisted.  "I say no." the man with grey hair countered, his smile unwavering.
2.19.A.jpg;            He smirked, his eyes twinkling with a hint of mischief.  "It's 8:8 so far, huh?" he said. his gaze fixed on the woman in the background, her expression a mix of nervousness and anticipation.
2.19.B.jpg;            He stood there, his face set in a determined expression, his eyes fixed on the group.  "How about Mr. Sung?"  he asked.
2.20.A.jpg;            His fist clenched tightly, the white object protruding from his palm a stark reminder of his desperate situation.  "On Sung's vote." the words echoed in his mind, each syllable a heavy weight.  "I don't have enough money..."  he thought. "Soon, I even need to send my little sister to college..."  his heart ached with the weight of his responsibility. 
2.20.B.jpg;            He lay there, his face pale, his body wracked with pain, his eyes filled with a mixture of desperation and sadness. "And..." he thought. "My sick mother..."  his voice cracked with emotion. "For my family!" he cried out. 
2.21.A.jpg;            He roared. his eyes blazing with determination. "I'm going!" he shouted, his body radiating with a fierce energy, his resolve unshakeable.
