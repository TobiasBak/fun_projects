2.5.D.jpg; The arrows point upwards, one yellow labeled "score" and the other blue labeled "reward."
2.5.E.jpg;  "How much time do I have?" the man asks, a thoughtful expression on his face.
2.5.F.jpg;  "We are currently about one week into this round already." the text reads, and a hand with long, sharp claws emerges from the shadows. 
2.5.G.jpg;  "The top group is probably as far ahead as they can be." the text reads, as the three figures hurry forward, their silhouettes casting long shadows.
2.5.H.0.jpg;  "Also, when you try finish a block, it is recommended that you form a party with around three to five people." the green man says, a mischievous glint in his eye.
2.5.H.1.jpg; A single yellow eye peers out from the darkness, its black pupil reflecting an unnerving glow.
2.5.I.jpg;  A green goblin, its sharp teeth bared, snarls from the darkness, a gold chain glinting around its neck.
2.6.A.jpg;  "The tower grows the foundation of the player's work." the text explains, "as your contributions increase and your work becomes more noteworthy, the way your score is calculated will be adjusted separately so there is no need to worry."
2.6.B.jpg;  "Usually, these types of players go one of two ways." the goblin says, eyeing the man in the background. "They either believe solely on their skill and die while acting high and mighty."
2.6.C.0.jpg;  "Or they become a sight to see." the text continues, "if that is what you mean then I will begin the trial immediately." 
2.6.C.1.jpg; The goblin smirks, a sly glint in its eye, as if it has gotten away with something. 
2.6.D.0.jpg;  The goblin listens intently, its head tilted down, as if considering the challenge before it.
2.6.D.1.jpg;  The goblin, its figure disappearing into the shadows, leaves quickly, its scheming intentions clear.
2.6.E.0.jpg;  The man stands in the hallway, his back to the viewer, a look of confusion and thoughtfulness on his face. 
2.6.E.1.jpg; The man, a determined glint in his eyes, charges forward, knife in hand, ready to attack. 
2.6.F.jpg; The black shoe, poised on the edge of the darkness, is about to crush the white light beneath it.
2.6.G.jpg; The black shoe stands firm, a powerful presence in the dark, ready to step on whatever lies ahead. 
2.7.A.0.jpg; A white blur, strong and fast, streaks across the image, heading for the darkness, creating a wind effect in its wake.
2.7.A.1.jpg; The man, his face a mask of fear, runs from the sharp object, his eyes wide with shock.
2.7.B.0.jpg;  The translucent man, determined and focused, dodges the traps in the hallway, his speed a blur against the dark walls. 
2.7.B.1.jpg;  "If the other hunters get to it first, our profits would dwindle." the man thinks, his hand gripping the large, curved sword tightly.
2.7.C.jpg; The person, their face focused and determined, walks quickly down the dark hallway, their backpack heavy on their shoulders.
2.7.D.0.jpg; The person, a blur of motion against the dark background, moves with speed and intensity, the lines of their movement leaving streaks of light.
2.7.D.1.jpg;  The man falls backward, his face contorted with shock and worry, his backpack landing heavily on the ground. 
2.8.A.jpg;  The man stares at the large, shadowed object with determination, his eyes narrowed in a glare.
2.8.B.jpg;  "I need to stick to the wall and lessen my body exposure as much as possible." the man thinks, his backpack shielding him from the danger.
2.8.C.jpg; The man, his face hardened with determination, races down the dark corridor, his weapon clutched firmly in his hand.
2.8.D.0.jpg;  The man, his eyes wide with shock and fear, looks up at the danger, his face pale in the darkness.
2.8.D.1.jpg; The man falls backward, his face contorted in pain, the darkness swallowing him as he crashes to the ground.
3.0.A.0.jpg;  The man stands, his face twisted in pain, "Extreme pain has overcome your body. You are now stunned." the message reads.  "Your 'cold blooded' nature will keep you composed." it continues, as he fights to stay strong. 
3.0.A.1.jpg;  "You are no longer stunned." the message reads, "you have developed a tolerance for this pain." The man stands, his injured shoulder throbbing, but his resolve unwavering.
3.0.B.jpg;  "I knew this was dangerous." the man thinks, "but I didn't expect it to this degree. This is going to drive me insane if things start out like this."
3.0.C.jpg;   The man, his knife held tight in his hand, stands firm, his eyes focused on the darkness ahead. "Keuk." he mutters. 
3.0.D.jpg;   The fabric burns fiercely, the flames dancing in the air, a sense of danger permeating the simple setting.
3.0.E.jpg;  "You have been burned. You are now stunned." the message reads.  "Your 'cold blooded' nature will keep you composed." it continues, as the man leans against the wall, trying to remain calm. 
3.0.F.jpg;  "You are no longer stunned." the message reads, "you have developed a resistance to burn." The man walks confidently, his two knives held tightly in his hand.
3.0.G.jpg;   "When the arrows were shot at me, it was timed." the man in the front says. "There was also a very faint signal too." he continues, looking at his companion.
3.1.A.jpg; "I need to find the right timing." the man thinks, "finding where the arrows are with the naked eye won't be possible because it is dark. I need to listen for when the cogwheel turns." 
3.1.B.jpg;  "That is the perfect time to find out the arrow's location and trajectory." the message reads. "During that short period of time, I need to listen for the exact sound that it makes." 
3.1.C.jpg;   The man stands with his eyes closed, his senses heightened, listening intently to the sounds around him.  
3.1.D.0.jpg;  The word "it's" stands alone on the page, surrounded by dark red lines, the air thick with a feeling of mystery and a hint of anger.
3.1.D.1.jpg;  A long metal rod protrudes from the edge of the page, a part of a gear visible at the bottom, the darkness surrounding them heavy with worry and anxiety. 
3.1.E.jpg; The man, his face etched with worry, looks up, a sense of relief washing over him, "I found it!" he exclaims. 
3.1.F.0.jpg; A small hole pierces the darkness, a single white line cutting through the black, the room shrouded in mystery.
3.1.F.1.jpg;  The man, his silhouette disappearing up the stairs, is swallowed by the shadows, the air heavy with a sense of mystery and unease.
3.1.G.jpg; The knife, its blade glinting in the darkness, is stuck in the black surface, the picture radiating an ominous, scary feeling.
3.2.A.0.jpg;  The two metal rods, sharp and red-tipped, lie crossed on the floor, the darkness around them amplifying their dangerous presence.
3.2.A.1.jpg;  The man, his face illuminated by the faint glow of the metal rods, looks down at them, "That's it." he says, a sense of triumph in his voice.  "I can find it now."
3.2.B.0.jpg; The man, his sword held tight in his hand, stands poised, his determined expression a testament to his unwavering resolve.  
3.2.B.1.jpg;  The man, his knife flashing in the darkness, races forward, his speed blurring against the dark backdrop. 
3.2.C.jpg;   "Your agility has gone up by 1." the message reads, as the man, a blur of motion, races forward, his blue arrow pointing the way.
3.2.D.jpg;  The man, a red arrow embedded in the blade of his dagger, stands poised, his eyes alert, the danger palpable in the air.  
3.3.A.0.jpg;   The man, struck by the yellow arrow, stands firm, his body tingling with the surge of newfound stamina.
3.3.A.1.jpg;  The man, his face hidden beneath his hood, walks down the dark path, a sense of mystery and wonder surrounding him.  
3.3.B.jpg;  The man, blood dripping from his mouth, stands in the darkness, his face contorted in horror and shock.
3.3.C.jpg;  "One thing that bugs me is that there is no way to increase my MP stat." the man says. "even so, if I can take advantage of this and steadily increase the stats that I want..." 
3.3.D.jpg; The man, his left hand stained with blood, stands in the blue area, a sense of pain and discomfort evident in his posture.  
3.3.E.0.jpg;  The green-skinned man, his eyes fixed on the screens, studies the images intently. "The more I observe him, the more interesting he becomes." he says, "I feel like he is the character who is the first of his kind."
3.3.E.1.jpg;  The green-skinned man, his monocle reflecting the light, strokes his chin thoughtfully.  "Strangely, my eyes are more drawn to the person in Block A who has his hands full than the people in Block E." he says, "This guy is the real one for sure." 
3.3.F.jpg;   The green-skinned man, his eyes narrowed in contemplation, gestures towards the screens, "Even if he qualifies, he will have to face many other dangers." he says, "But if he can be this sensible and pass the rest..."  
3.3.G.jpg; "I feel like a lot of fun spectacle will arise during this tutorial." the creature says, a smile spreading across its face. 
3.4.A.jpg;  The creature, its monocle glinting in the dim light, scans the grid of images with amusement.  
3.4.B.0.jpg;  "You have reached the end point." the message reads, highlighting the box in blue. "Except for MP, all the other stats have substantially gone up."  
3.4.B.1.jpg;  The man, his face beaming with satisfaction, looks at the screen in his hand.  "Stats have substantially gone up." he says, "Going up this much in a day is a pretty good outcome." 
3.4.C.jpg; The man, his stoic expression unwavering, stands against the wall, his eyes fixed on the darkness ahead, "And it's not just that." he says. 
3.4.D.jpg;  The man, his fists clenched tightly, looks down at his hands, "My physical strength, mobility, endurance, and destructive power have all gone up." he says. 
3.4.E.jpg;  The man, his gaze determined, walks forward, his left hand outstretched,  reaching for the unknown. 
3.4.F.jpg;   The man, his face pale, stands in the yellow light, his eyes filled with worry.  "Treatment of your wounds will now begin." the message reads.
3.4.G.jpg;   The man, his expression unreadable, stands bathed in the yellow light, his body radiating an aura of power.
3.4.H.jpg;   The man, his brow furrowed in confusion, looks at the door,  "An area for players to rest." the message reads. 
3.5.A.jpg; The man, his sword clutched tightly in his hand, walks forward, the yellow glow around him a testament to his recent injuries, but his determination remains unshaken. 
3.5.B.jpg;  "I can finally catch my breath now." the man says, his face calm and collected, as the yellow energy trails fade around him. 
3.5.C.jpg; The man, unconscious and injured, lies next to the grey wall, the yellow energy trails swirling around him, a sense of fear and worry hanging in the air.
3.5.D.jpg;   The white text stands out against the black backdrop, the silence punctuated by the anticipation of what is to come. 
3.5.E.jpg;  The man, his face hidden beneath the white hoodie, stands with his arms raised, his smile wide and inviting, "Peek-a-boo?" he says.
3.5.F.jpg;  The man in the white hoodie, his arms still raised, stares in surprise and confusion, his eyes wide with disbelief. 
3.5.G.jpg;   "This person, who is he?" the man in the black jacket asks, his hand gripping the gun. "I'm sure my heightened senses skill was still in effect. How did I not notice that he was next to me?" 
3.6.A.jpg;  "Perhaps." the man thinks, his brow furrowed, "A mystery merchant?"
3.6.B.jpg;  "It's a relief that you know who I am." the man in the white hoodie says, his smile widening.  "I love you, dearest solicit, I mean customer." he continues. "Allow me to introduce myself. My name is 'A,' the merchant who passes by."
3.6.C.jpg;  The man in the grey hoodie, his eyes gleaming with mischief, looks ahead.  "Occasionally, merchants would appear at the end point to supply the players with what they need in exchange for payment." he says, "Hohoht!" 
3.6.D.0.jpg;  "After coming this far, did something that you really need come to mind, sir?" the robed merchant asks, his smile widening.  "Starting from commonplace food, potions, skillbooks, and even all kinds of artifacts. A merchant who sells everything in the world." 
3.6.D.1.jpg;  The blue screen glows, its white text illuminating the darkness, "I'm a merchant who sells everything that exists in this world." it reads. "If you are in need of something, please let me know." 
3.6.E.jpg;  "Hmm..." the man says, his brow furrowed, studying the screen in his hand, his curiosity piqued.
3.6.F.0.jpg;  The green liquid in the glass bottle bubbles ominously, the golden horn gleaming at its base. "Medusa's venom." the text reads. "Golden goat's." 
3.6.F.1.jpg;  The giant blue eye, its gaze intense, floats in the air, the golden horn a testament to its power. "Tiamat's left eye..." the text reads. 
3.6.G.jpg;  "There is no way a tutorial player could acquire these types of items." the man says, shaking his head. "I'm not at the stage where I can rely on artifacts or skills. Let's just focus on physical training." 
3.6.H.jpg;  "I found it!" the man says, his face alight with excitement.
3.6.I.jpg;  The two tickets, one marked "[reset ticket]" and the other "reset ticket." offer a glimmer of hope, a chance to start anew. 
3.6.J.jpg;  "You can go back to a certain desired point." the merchant explains. "How will I pay for these items here?" the man asks. "With your stats, sir." the merchant replies, his smile widening. 
3.7.A.jpg; "You just need to pay the correct amount." the merchant says. "We are merchants with a conscience who only offer reasonable prices." he continues. "Mineral water for 2 strength?" the man scoffs, "This is highway robbery at its finest."  
3.7.B.jpg; "Yes, what would you like?" the woman asks, her smile warm and welcoming. "There is something I would like to purchase." the man replies. 
3.7.C.jpg;  The woman, her hands clasped in front of her, smiles serenely.  "By offering all of the stats I accumulated in Block A as payment." she says.
3.7.D.0.jpg;  "I would like to purchase a ticket that will reset Block A." the man says, his determination evident in his voice.
3.7.D.1.jpg;  The man, his arms crossed, stands confidently in the darkness, his white mask obscuring his eyes.
4.0.A.jpg;  "Are you talking about a reset ticket?" the man asks, examining the menu. "That's right." the woman confirms.
4.0.B.0.jpg;  The woman, her brow furrowed, contemplates the request. "You're the first person to ask for it." she says. "People often ask for something that will help them advance to the next stage easily, so there is no one who asks for something that will require a do over." 
4.0.B.1.jpg;  "It's because there is something I want to do." the man says.
4.0.C.jpg;  "I see." the woman says, a sly smile playing on her lips. "He's an entertaining participant..." she continues, her gaze fixed on the man. 
4.0.D.jpg;  The man, his eyes fixed on the ticket, studies it intently. "Using the ticket is incredibly easy." the text reads. "If you rip the ticket at a location of your choice, you will be recalled to the starting zone."
4.0.E.jpg;  The man, his back turned, walks away, the woman waving goodbye. "You will be recalled to the starting zone." the text reads.  "I shall now take my leave, hoping that we will meet again next time." the woman says. 
4.0.F.jpg;  The man walked down the pathway, the silence amplifying his footsteps.
4.0.G.jpg;  The man looked down at his hands, feeling a wave of weakness wash over him. "I feel like my strength is leaving me." he muttered.
4.0.H.jpg;  Relief flooded the man's face as he read the message on the paper. "You have acquired 'block a reset ticket' x10."
4.0.I.jpg;  He ripped the ticket in half, frustration bubbling to the surface. 
4.1.A.0.jpg;  The man stared in disbelief, his eyes widening in horror.
4.1.A.1.jpg;  He held his hands out, a surge of power coursing through them, a beacon of hope in the darkness.
4.1.B.jpg;  The man stumbled back, his face a mask of shock and fear.
4.1.C.jpg;  The man stood in the dimly lit room, a sense of unease settling over him. "This is floor 0, where you start the tutorial." a voice whispered in his head.
4.1.D.jpg;  He squared his shoulders, determination hardening his gaze. "Floor 0's trial will now begin. I will accumulate as much stats as possible here."
4.1.E.0.jpg;  The darkness seemed to pulse, a chilling reminder of the unknown that lay ahead. 
4.1.E.1.jpg;  The man stood firm, his weapon held tight, ready to face whatever danger lay ahead.
4.1.F.jpg;  Arrows whizzed past him, each one a threat to his life, but he dodged them with practiced ease, his movements a blur of determination.
4.2.A.jpg;  He scanned the area, his eyes narrowed in focus. "This is my last tutorial run." he muttered, a sense of finality in his voice.
4.2.B.0.jpg;  He stared ahead, a thoughtful expression on his face. "Synesthesia is now in the palm of my hand." he whispered, tracing the lines of a skill that felt like a new sense. "Dragon visual prowess, a skill where I can partially use the ancient dragon Calatuz's eyes of truth."
4.2.B.1.jpg;  The man gazed at the dragon, a flicker of pride in his eyes.  
4.2.C.jpg;  He walked down the stark white hallway, the silence echoing in his ears. "The dragon visual prowess got rid of all of the color in my field of vision. All I could see was a white background and black lines." 
4.2.D.jpg;  He stood, his body a testament to the power of his training. "My brother called this phenomenon, 'gyeol.' Lines that bring out the outline of the object."
4.2.E.0.jpg;  He reached the door, a sense of accomplishment washing over him. "You have reached the end point."
4.2.E.1.jpg;  He slumped against the wall, exhaustion weighing heavy on him. The journey had been long and arduous. 
4.3.A.jpg;  He stared at the screen, a mix of awe and relief on his face. "Did this take around 4 hours? For something that once took me 34 hours to complete, this is a big accomplishment for me." 
4.3.B.jpg;  He looked at his stats, despair washing over him. "With stats like this, it'll be enough for me to get destroyed by other people."
4.3.C.jpg;  He clenched his jaw, his resolve hardening. "The top players are probably already on their way to Block A. If I fall behind even more than now, I won't be able to catch up to them. It is now time to seriously begin this race."
4.3.D.jpg;  He stood at the entrance, a chill running down his spine. "You have now entered Block A's boss room."
4.3.E.jpg;  He stared ahead, his eyes burning with ambition. "I'm going to clear both Block A and B."
4.3.F.0.jpg;  He sprinted down the hallway, the echoes of his footsteps pounding in his ears.
4.3.F.1.jpg;  He ran, his knife clutched tightly in his hand, his every muscle tensed with determination.
4.3.G.jpg;  He surged forward, flames licking at his heels, his speed fueled by adrenaline.
4.3.H.jpg;  He skidded to a halt, his eyes wide with surprise. "The pace is faster than expected."
4.4.A.jpg;  He gritted his teeth, pushing himself harder. "I can't slow down here." 
4.4.B.jpg;  He climbed the stairs, his steps heavy with determination. 
4.4.C.0.jpg; He sprinted down the stairs, his heart pounding in his chest, every sense screaming at him to move faster.
4.4.C.1.jpg; The stairs stretched before him, each step a potential hazard, a testament to the danger that lurked around every corner. 
4.4.D.jpg; He stared down the shaft, his stomach twisting with dread. "Falling means instant death." the words echoed in his mind as he cautiously lowered himself.
4.4.E.jpg; He crouched, his eyes narrowed with determination. "If that's the case..."  
4.4.F.0.jpg; He pressed himself against the wall, his senses on high alert, waiting for the inevitable threat.
4.4.F.1.jpg;  He walked along the ledge, his steps light and sure, the spikes below a constant reminder of the dangers that surrounded him.
4.5.A.jpg; He crept through the tunnel, the silence amplifying every sound, the darkness pressing in on him from all sides.
4.5.B.jpg; He slumped to his knees, his shoulders slumping in defeat. "Your agility has gone up by 1." the message mocked him.
4.5.C.jpg; He froze, his eyes widening in alarm as he saw the fire engulfing the tunnel ahead.
4.5.D.jpg;  He lunged forward, his movements a blur of fury, ready to face whatever danger lay before him. 
4.5.E.jpg;  He slashed his dagger through the air, a fiery inferno erupting behind him, his movements fluid and powerful.
4.5.F.jpg;  He stood amidst the flames, his body radiating heat. "Due to your 'cold-blooded' nature, you have developed a resistance to burns." a voice echoed in his head. "The 'heightened senses' skill level has gone up."
4.5.G.jpg;  He bolted forward, the explosion a roaring inferno behind him, his determination burning as bright as the flames.
4.5.H.jpg;  He clung to the edge, his knuckles white with strain, his heart pounding in his chest.
4.6.A.0.jpg;  He gritted his teeth, his body screaming in pain, his resolve unyielding. "Your strength..."  "Ughh!"
4.6.A.1.jpg;  He planted his foot, his muscles straining, every fiber of his being focused on pushing forward.
4.6.B.jpg;  He knelt, his eyes scanning the area, his senses on high alert, every muscle tense with anticipation.
4.6.C.jpg; He stared ahead, his eyes narrowed, a sense of unease settling over him. "This thing is..."
4.6.D.0.jpg;  The creature loomed before him, its copper skin glinting in the dim light. "Are these the things that copy the players?"  "[Copper Scarecrow]"
4.6.D.1.jpg;  The creature stood, a perfect imitation of a player, its movements eerily lifelike. "A scarecrow that imitates the player's movements and actions exactly. It is also capable of attacking within a certain range. My brother also mentioned these things as well."  
4.6.E.jpg;  The man approached the cloaked figure, their expressions grim as they faced the three mechanical figures blocking their path. "These things can copy the skills of players and use it against them with more force." the cloaked figure said. "If you can defeat them, you will be allowed to enter the boss room, but if you cannot defeat them, it'll be like being tied down by a ball and chain."
4.7.A.0.jpg;  He held his weapon, his eyes narrowed in focus. "Or stab through them." 
4.7.A.1.jpg;  His gaze was intense, his single visible eye burning with a strange yellow light. "Dragon eyes."
4.7.B.jpg;  He stood before the robot, his grip tightening on his knife. "Ctl note: the skill name is 'dragon visual prowess' but I chose to tl it as 'dragon eyes' when he activates them because I thought it would be weird if he said 'dragon visual prowess' to activate them. Hope that makes sense."
4.7.C.jpg;  The robot lurched, its armor groaning in protest. "That place is the weak point." 
4.7.D.jpg;  He plunged his knife into the robot's chest, a sickening crunch echoing in the air.
4.7.E.jpg;  She screamed. "That thing moves according to its sensors. Find the sensors and aim for those!"
4.7.F.jpg;  He crouched, his eyes darting around, a sense of unease washing over him.
4.8.A.0.jpg;  He held his knife, his brow furrowed with suspicion. "Maybe this is the person I noticed when my senses were heightened."
4.8.A.1.jpg;  The robot lay crumpled on the ground, its armor dented and scarred, its movements halted. 
4.8.B.0.jpg;  He groaned, his hand pressed against his throbbing head. "I already knew that the scarecrows move according to its sensors." 
4.8.B.1.jpg;  He lay on the ground, his vision spinning, the world suddenly upside down.
4.8.C.jpg;  He crouched, his eyes narrowed, watching the fire erupt behind him.
4.8.D.jpg;  She watched him go, her heart heavy with a sense of loss. "No..." 
4.8.E.jpg;  He stared at the wall, his face a mixture of disbelief and shock. "No way..."
5.0.A.jpg;  She watched him go, her heart heavy with a sense of loss.
5.0.B.jpg;  The man with black hair watched the other man, fear gripping his heart.
5.0.C.jpg;  The man with black hair stood in the doorway, a smug look on his face. "I was barely able to figure out that the copper puppet operates with its sensors by using my heightened senses. This is something that normal players probably couldn't have figured out." The man with blue hair stood in the doorway, his eyes wide with astonishment. 
5.0.D.jpg;  The woman with blue hair stared at the man, her face a mask of confusion. "So how did he know?"
5.0.E.jpg;  He glared at the camera, his face twisted with anger. "What are you going to do to me? A weak looking person like him." 
5.0.F.jpg;  The woman glared at him. "I'm asking what your intentions are!"  He stared back, a hint of amusement in his eyes. "Do what to you?"
5.0.G.jpg;  He shook his head. "I don't have any. How did you know? About what?"
5.0.H.jpg;  She frowned, her eyes wide with confusion. "What? Wel..."  "The fact that the copper puppet operates with its sensors. I'm asking how you knew."
5.0.I.jpg;  The copper puppet pulsed with blue energy, its magical strings snapping into place. "I was able to see the magical string that was enveloping the copper puppet. As expected..." 
5.0.J.jpg;  He pondered, a thoughtful expression on his face. "He is able to see magic. This means that he has an extremely high affinity to it even amongst those who can control magic. How you can 'see' and control this magic is what I am most interested in." 
5.1.A.jpg;  Her eyes widened in shock. "If I can learn the technique, it will be a big help for me when it comes to learning how to control magic. What?"  "Granted, I won't ask you to teach me for free. Tsnote: this guy pisses me off c do they speak english in 'what'?"
5.1.B.jpg;  The hallway stretched before them, a maze of darkness and shadows. "It seems like you've been trapped here for a while. I will help you get out of here. How about it? It's not a bad condition for you, don't you think?"
5.1.C.jpg;  She stared at him, her face pale with fear. He simply looked back, his expression unreadable.
5.1.D.jpg;  She reached out. "It seems it's a no. T-that's not it, wait!"
5.1.E.jpg;  She stared at him. "Is what you just said really the truth?" He returned her gaze. "The fact that you are unable to control magic. I don't have a reason to lie." 
5.1.F.jpg;  He stared at the cylindrical objects, his face a mixture of confusion and disbelief. "You're telling me that something like that is possible when you can't even control magic? T-that makes no sense!"
5.1.G.jpg;  The two men stood in the alley, their faces etched with a mixture of surprise and concern. "He is able to completely obliterate something like that with a couple of hits and he can't control magic?"  "Normally, no matter how many skills you use, or how many physical blows you land, there isn't even a scratch on it."
5.1.H.jpg;  He stood there, his face a mask of bewilderment, a question mark hovering above his head. "He did say that. Just who is this..."
5.1.I.jpg;  The man with dark blue hair looked at the puppet, his face contorted in a mixture of shock and confusion. "Alright. I'll help you." 
5.2.A.jpg;  The man with dark blue hair stood, his expression determined. "My name is Yool. What shall I do for you?"
5.2.B.jpg;  The two men stood, the man with black hair giving instructions. "Alright. Yool. Firstly, I'll open up a path so follow right behind me. Got it."
5.2.C.jpg;  The man stood, his eyes glowing a menacing yellow. "However..."
5.2.D.jpg;  The man with dark blue hair looked at him, his eyes widening in surprise. "Why are you presenting yourself like that?"
5.2.E.jpg;  His eyes glowed, a sinister glint in their depths. "How you look right now is a facade."
5.2.F.jpg;  The man with dark blue hair stood in the light gray area, a confused look on his face. "You're probably 10 years old, inside and out? You're young. You're short. You must not be a normal person?" 
5.2.G.jpg;  He stood, his hands clasped behind his back, his gaze fixed on the girl. "Just because you are a child doesn't mean I'll be lenient."  The girl stood, her form wavering, her expression a mix of sadness and understanding. "...I understand." 
5.3.A.jpg;  He moved with a blur of speed, his body a whirlwind of motion, his expression deadly serious.  
5.3.B.jpg;  The figure stood, a radiant aura surrounding them, their body contorted in a stance of immense power. 
5.3.C.jpg;  He leaped, his sword glinting in the dim light, his movements fluid and precise. 
5.3.D.0.jpg; He landed, his body tense, his eyes focused on the path ahead. 
5.3.D.1.jpg;  He hovered in the air, his body poised, his face hidden by the shadows.
5.3.E.jpg;  He stood, his gaze steady, his expression calm, as the girl stared at him in surprise. 
5.3.F.jpg;  He walked, his pace steady. "We are almost at Block B." The girl walked beside him, her surprise evident in her voice. "Shouldn't you speak up now that we are here? Ah."
5.3.G.jpg;  The girl stood, her eyes wide with curiosity. "I don't know how you'll think of this, but I am innately able to visually 'see' mana."
5.4.A.jpg;  The woman stood, her face a mixture of shock and disbelief. "Innately?" 
5.4.B.jpg; The man in the black hoodie glances to his left, a flicker of confusion in his eyes. The person beside him, hidden in the shadows, watches with a similar expression. 
5.4.C.0.jpg; The text reads about how the skills passed down through generations are awakened at a special time, leading to great achievements. 
5.4.C.1.jpg; Bathed in a radiant white light, the man stands tall, radiating an aura of power and hope. 
5.4.D.jpg; "Yool informed me he's one of those cases." the man in front says, "My inherited skill allows me to feel, see, and taste magic. It's like I have an affinity for it."  He continues, "That's how I knew the copper puppet was connected to its sensors." "Is he a similar case to Jeong-woo?" the man behind him asks. 
5.4.E.jpg; The bright, white light pulsates with a green aura, as if a hidden power is being unleashed. The text explains that the man's brother had the ability of "perfect adaptation." making him compatible with even mana itself. 
5.4.F.jpg; A slight smile graces the man's lips as he looks to his right, a glow emanating from his left arm. "Instead of the hardships others experience." the text reads, "He felt no discomfort when working with mana. It's as if he recovered a precious item and could control it like an expert."
5.4.G.jpg; A monstrous black dragon roars, its orange eye burning with power, surrounded by a fiery inferno. The text tells the tale of its special traits, which caused the ancient dragon Calatz to choose it. 
5.5.A.jpg;  A blue aura swirls around the man's open hand as he looks to his right. "He could communicate with all things." the text explains, "and so inherited the dragon's foundational skills, unlike ordinary people.  Both of them are classified as geniuses, though I am not." "You can view mana as a type of river." the text continues, "Magic is the water from small ridges or a reservoir flowing through that river."
5.5.B.jpg; "A reservoir you say?" the man in the hoodie asks, his hand raised as if making a gesture, his gaze fixed on the person beside him. 
5.5.C.jpg; "800 karma..." reads the text below the man, a sense of accomplishment evident in his posture.  The notifications on the wall confirm his karma increase, replenished stamina and mana, leaving him with a total of 800 karma. 
5.5.D.jpg; "If you are a player, your goal is to accumulate as many points as possible." the text reads above the man with the backpack. He looks stressed, clutching his backpack.  The other man, calm and confident, says, "I've only cleared Block A, but I've already accumulated so much. People would be astounded if they heard about this."
5.5.E.jpg; The young man runs his hand along the wall, his face set in a determined expression. "This isn't enough." he thinks, "I need to accumulate more... as much as I can."
5.5.F.0.jpg; The sign at the top of the room reads, "You have now entered Block B." The room is bathed in white light, spacious and clean. 
5.5.F.1.jpg;  The man stands alone in the vast grey plaza, his figure dwarfed by the towering structures and the countless people who seem to be everywhere. He looks lost and alone. 
5.5.G.jpg; The man with the grey hair stands resolute, sword in hand, looking at the scene before him. Three people sit before him, the man in the middle holding a dagger, the one on the left with a rope tied around his arm. In the background, people sit and lie on stairs, their faces etched with pain. 
5.6.A.0.jpg; "It's been a week since the tutorial started, and there's still a qualifier?" the text reads. The man with the black hair looks confused, his gaze fixed on the suited man behind him.  "What, what's with that guy?" another text asks, "And what's with the mask?"
5.6.A.1.jpg; The man with the black hair stands on the left, a woman with blonde hair beside him. Her gaze is fixed on something in the distance, as if she's noticed something unusual. "Did he clear Block A's brutal course by himself or something?" the text below her reads.
5.6.B.jpg;  The man in the hooded jacket stands in front of a door, his hand on the handle, a gun held tightly in his other hand. "What are you doing, instead of coming in?" he asks. The man with blue hair looks confused, glancing at the blurry figures in the background. 
5.6.C.jpg; Relief washes over the man's face as a smile breaks out. "Finally..." the text reads above him.
5.6.D.jpg;  The man with blue hair, a nervous expression on his face, stands in front of a wall of squares, his hands raised in a questioning gesture. "I finally made it out..." he says. 
5.6.E.jpg; The young man's eyes widen in surprise, his mouth agape. His expression conveys a mix of concern and shock. 
5.6.F.jpg;  The group of characters stand in the alleyway, their expressions a mix of anticipation and uncertainty. The blonde haired man, sword at his side, looks directly at the viewer, while the black haired man holds a bottle, his expression neutral.  The others, their faces partially hidden, seem poised for action. 
5.6.G.jpg; The group of four characters stands close together, their faces etched with worry. Their eyes are locked on the viewer, the tension palpable. The dark setting and apprehensive expressions create a sense of uncertainty.
5.6.H.jpg;  The young man closes his eyes, concentrating intensely, his eyebrows furrowed. His expression is a mixture of seriousness and determination, as if he's channeling some hidden power.
5.7.A.jpg;  A smirk plays on the man's lips, his confident and arrogant expression evident. He appears to be in control, radiating an aura of self-assurance. 
5.7.B.jpg;  The man with dark blue hair, his hair tied back, glares to the left, a hint of anger in his eyes. "They are your teammates?" the text above the masked man asks. "They 'were'!" the blue haired man replies. "Now they have nothing to do with me."
5.7.C.jpg; The man with dark blue hair looks surprised, his eyebrows raised in confusion. "Where was I with the explanation?" the masked man asks.  "You were talking about the mana stream or something."
5.7.D.jpg; "About that." the blue haired man says, his gaze fixed on the masked man. "To my surprise, Yool knew a lot about magic." The masked man responds. "The information was hard to understand as usual, but I was able to get a rough idea about the concepts of magic and mana." 
5.7.E.jpg; The masked man, his face thoughtful, stares directly at the viewer. "I now have a rough idea of what magic is." he muses. "The easy way to control it..." He pauses, his expression turning contemplative. "No, the easiest way to feel it would be?"
5.7.F.jpg; "I'm not so sure myself." the blue haired man says, his hand resting on his head, a look of frustration on his face. "To be honest, I was able to control it from the start, so it's hard for me to explain to you how to do it." The masked man nods, his expression neutral. "Is that so." he says. "Well, it can't be helped." 
5.7.G.jpg; "Ah, yes." the man in the black jacket says, "Then let's part ways here." The man with the brown shirt looks surprised. "I'm assuming that after waiting to finish the tutorial, you will head to the outside?" he asks.
5.7.H.jpg; The man in the black hoodie raises his hand in a farewell wave. The other man smiles, returning the gesture. They are surrounded by a group of men, their faces obscured by the blur of the image. 
5.7.I.jpg; The man in the brown shirt stares in shock as he walks away from the man in the black hoodie.  "!" he exclaims. 
5.7.J.jpg;  "Hey, Yool." the text reads above the man, who walks with a blank expression, his face hidden behind the white mask. 
6.0.A.jpg; The man in the black shirt smiles, his eyes meeting the admiration of the four men standing before him. "I love the looks in your eyes." he says, "People like you guys tend to do big things when you make things happen."
6.0.B.jpg; "I'm Build, an execu-tive of Arangdan." the man says, his hand extended in greeting. "I'll be in Block B's waiting room, so if you are thinking about proceeding, let's go together."
6.0.C.jpg;  The man with blonde hair smirks, his eyes sparkling with excitement. "To think that Arangdan would scout us!" he says. "If it's Arangdan, then you're referring to the unstoppable group that totally dominated the tutorial level?"
6.0.D.0.jpg; The long, narrow hallway stretches into the darkness, its walls a deep, bluish-green.  The silence is broken only by the faint echo of footsteps. 
6.0.D.1.jpg;  The man with blonde hair stands firm, his gaze fixed on the other man. "Don't budge!" he warns. Several other men stand behind them, their lower bodies obscured by the darkness. 
6.0.E.jpg;  The man with blonde hair clenches his sword, his face a mask of worry. "We're in trouble." he says. "If things continue like this, finishing the tutorial won't even be in the equation, let alone leaving this place with our lives." 
6.0.F.jpg;  The man's eyes widen in fear, his mouth open in a silent scream. His brow is furrowed, his expression etched with anxiety.
6.0.G.jpg; The two men stand close together, their bodies tense.  The blonde haired man looks to his left, a worried expression on his face. The man with blue hair, holding a knife, looks in the same direction, his face a mask of anxiety. 
6.0.H.jpg;  The blonde haired man frowns, his expression laced with frustration.  "Yool's ability is simply analyzing the flow of magic." the text reads above him. The blue haired man looks confused, his eyes wide with disappointment.  "He isn't much help because he just stays back." the text above him states. 
6.0.I.jpg; The blue haired man stares in shock, his mouth agape, his eyes wide with surprise. "In that case..." the text above him reads. "What, what are you doing?!" the text below him exclaims. 
6.0.J.0.jpg;  "?!" the text above the blue haired man screams, as figures surround him, their movements a blur.  "Now!" the text below him shouts. The man sits on the ground, his face a mask of fear. 
6.0.J.1.jpg;  "Run!" the text above the blonde haired man shouts.  The three men stand close together, their faces a mixture of fear and determination. 
6.0.K.jpg;  "All of you!" the text above the blue haired man yells. His eyes are wide, his hand raised in a gesture of desperate appeal. 
6.1.B.jpg;  The man with the ponytail glares at the viewer, his mouth open in annoyance.  "What do you want?" he asks. "Do we still have things to discuss?"
6.1.C.jpg;  The dark haired man stands in front of the blonde haired man, his face contorted in anger. "How did you..." he begins. "That's none of your business, don't you think?" the blonde haired man responds, his eyes fixed on the other man. "....." the dark haired man finishes, his words lost in the heat of the argument. 
6.1.D.jpg;  The blue haired man sticks out his tongue, his eyes blazing with anger.  "I don't know what you want to say, but piss off." he says. "All of you probably feel uncomfortably awkward seeing me here, and it sickens me having to look at you all." 
6.1.E.jpg;  The group of characters, all clad in brown jackets, stand in the light-colored room, their faces etched with worry. "Let's just act like we don't know each other until the tutorial round is over." one of them suggests. 
6.1.F.jpg;  The man bows his head, his face flushed with embarrassment. "I'm sorry!" he says.  "?!" he murmurs, his head still bowed. 
6.1.G.jpg;  The man with blue hair stands behind the woman, his eyes fixed on her, his expression angry.  "I want to apologize to you however I can, for what happened before." he says. The woman looks shocked, her eyes wide with disbelief.  "What kind of nonsense is this?" she asks. "In exchange, please keep what happened before a secret." she whispers. 
6.1.H.jpg; The man looks down, his face filled with regret. "Not long before... no. When it comes to the details, I don't exactly know how to tell you, but..." he begins.  "What happened between us, please don't go around telling people." he pleads. "I beg of you."
6.1.I.jpg;  The man with blue hair stands tall, his gaze fixed on the kneeling man.  "Please!" he pleads. "Yool, I beg of you. I'm counting on you." The kneeling man looks up, his face filled with despair. 
6.1.J.jpg;  The man with blue hair glares at the others, his mouth open in a sneer.  "Ts note: I kinda like this guy now." the text reads above him.  "I don't really know what you all are blabbering about, but get lost." he says. "I don't ever want to see any of your faces again."
6.1.K.jpg; The man with brown hair stands in front of the other man, his expression filled with concern. The man with blue hair walks away, his face set in a determined expression. 
6.1.L.jpg;  The man looks down, his face etched with worry. "Things can't end like this." he thinks. "I already told Build that Yool sacrificed himself."
6.1.M.jpg;  The man looks to the right, his face twisted in anger. "If he were to ever say the wrong thing one day...!", he thinks. "I'll end up losing my position that I was scouted out for in Arangdan."
6.1.N.jpg; The man with brown hair looks anxious, his eyes wide with worry. "If the other hunters get to it first, our profits would dwindle." he says. The other man, his face a mask of surprise, listens intently. 
6.2.A.jpg;  The man with brown hair stands tall, his expression grim. "It was hard abandoning him the first time." he says, his gaze fixed on the men behind him. "However, the second time won't be." The men behind him look scared, their faces pale with fear. 
6.2.B.jpg; The five men stand in a circle, their faces illuminated by the warm light of the setting sun. They look down at the large circular structure, their expressions confident and optimistic.  "Thankfully, we're in a secluded area where no one is really keeping an eye on it, so I'll just do a good job of doing it secretly." one of them says. 
6.2.C.jpg;  The man with brown hair, holding a sword, stands in front of the blue haired man. "Build doesn't even know how Yool looks like anyway." he says, his eyes locked on the other man.  The blue haired man looks surprised, his eyes widening in disbelief. 
6.2.D.jpg;  The hand reaches out, grasping the wood with a firm grip. The air crackles with uncertainty. "I can just cover this up by saying he was a casualty from the boss room." the unseen voice whispers,  a sense of unease hanging in the air.
6.2.E.jpg;  The man with brown hair stares in shock, his mouth agape.  "Within the tutorial, Arangdan is a group that is directly associated with the Blue Flower Island." the text reads,  "So people say that newbies are selected from there. However, the people of Blue Flower Island are apparently very fussy, so it is said that they feel uncomfortable around people with a bad past."  He looks at the other men. "You guys can't even do what he did."
6.2.F.jpg; The man with brown hair clutches the hilt of his sword, his eyes wide with disbelief. "Who in the..." he stammers. 
6.2.G.0.jpg; The man roars, his face contorted in fury. The red background seems to amplify his rage. 
6.2.G.1.jpg; The blue haired man looks confused, his eyebrows furrowed, his eyes fixed on the unseen speaker.  "?" he asks. 
6.2.H.jpg; The man in the black hoodie and white mask stands over the injured man, his face hidden by the mask. "My hand!" he says. cruel whisper, as he raises the knife.  The man on the ground screams.  "My haaand!" he cries, his hand clutched to his chest.  
6.2.I.jpg;  The man in the black hoodie and white mask stands in the dim light of the room, his expression serious.  "If things went my way, I would have peacefully headed to Block B, but..." he thinks, his mind racing. "After learning that Yool was betrayed by his teammates, it made me waver and made me feel like I had to step in."
6.2.J.jpg; The man closed his eyes, lost in thought. He could see someone else's figure, a memory from Yool, a feeling of regret weighing him down. 
6.2.K.jpg;  He turned away, his back bowed under the weight of two swords. The swords were a reminder of his younger brother, forced to carry the burden of his comrades' loss.
6.3.A.0.jpg;  A sharp retort escaped his lips, "If you have the audacity to stab someone in the back." he spat, his anger evident.
6.3.A.1.jpg; "This person is a pro!"  He sneered, his masked face radiating confidence, "You should at least be prepared to lose one of your wrists, don't you think?"
6.3.B.jpg;  His eyes narrowed, a sinister glint in them. "You bastard..." he growled, his anger simmering, "You dare do this to my hand!"
6.3.C.jpg; "I'll kill you!" he roared, his sword flashing in the dimly lit room. The man with the backpack braced himself, fear etched across his face. 
6.3.D.jpg;  He stood frozen, shock etched across his masked face. 
6.3.E.jpg; The hand tightened around the hilt of the sword, its grip unwavering,  a symbol of power and resolve.
6.3.F.0.jpg;  He tilted his head slightly, a smirk playing on his lips, "Keep trying." 
6.3.F.1.jpg; The man with light brown hair struggled against the man holding him down. "Ah ah ah" he yelled, his face contorted in frustration. 
6.3.G.jpg;  "I'll just make it so that you will never walk again." he promised. his eyes burning with a hatred that chilled the air.
6.3.H.jpg; The man with grey hair was fuming, "What, what's the deal! You don't have anything to do with him!" His anger was palpable. "So why are you stepping in!" he yelled. 
6.3.I.jpg; "You guys do what you want, so there isn't anything stopping me from doing the same." he declared, his white mask hiding the emotions behind his words.  "W-what?"  The man with black hair stumbled back, his face etched with confusion.
6.3.J.jpg; "Drop your weapons." a voice called out, the words carrying an air of authority. Both men held their swords, their faces a mixture of fear and apprehension.  
6.3.K.jpg; "I said drop them." he growled, his hand gripping the man's arm, his eyes narrowed, his expression cold and unforgiving.
6.3.L.jpg; "Drop them! I said drop them!" he pleaded. his eyes wide with fear. "Please!"
6.4.A.jpg; The three men watched, their expressions a mix of surprise and wonder, as the swords clattered to the floor, their blades flashing in the dim light.
6.4.B.jpg;  "N-now, let Kaen go." the man with brown hair pleaded. his eyes fixed on the man with black hair. 
6.4.C.jpg;  "Idiots." he sneered, his smile mocking, his eyes holding a cruel glint, a clear indication of his superiority. 
6.4.D.jpg;  A hand shot out, its grip firm, pulling the unseen person towards the unknown,  their screams lost in the darkness, their fear palpable. 
6.4.E.jpg;  "Keuaaaah!" the man with brown hair screamed, his face contorted in pain as he was stepped on, his fear evident. The masked man stood over him, his expression unwavering. 
6.4.F.jpg;  "Hhh." the man with blond hair groaned, his face twisted in pain as the black shoe crushed his arm.  He lay there, defeated, his body wracked with agony.
6.4.G.jpg;  "Hey, that wasn't the..." he yelled, his face a mask of shock and frustration. His anger was evident as he watched what had just happened.
6.4.H.0.jpg;  He stumbled, his face contorted in pain, his brown jacket flapping in the wind as he sprinted forward.
6.4.H.1.jpg;  The man in the white mask moved with a speed that belied his determination. His eyes were focused, his every movement deliberate.
6.4.I.jpg; The man in the black jacket landed a powerful punch, sending the man in the brown jacket crashing to the ground. He stood over him, his expression unwavering.
6.4.J.jpg; Both men were ready to fight. Their anger was palpable, their expressions a mix of hatred and determination.  
6.4.K.0.jpg; "Dieeee!" a voice yelled, as the man in the white jacket fell to the ground, his body tumbling through the air.
6.4.K.1.jpg;  "E." the man in the white jacket screamed as he plummeted towards the ground.  The man in the black jacket, his face a mask of determination, ran below him, his movements swift and precise. 
7.0.A.jpg;   "If the other hunters get to it first, our profits would dwindle." he muttered, his eyes fixed on the fight. The man in the black jacket, his knife flashing, was in the middle of a chaotic, action-packed brawl. 
7.0.B.jpg; The man in the black jacket, his white mask hiding his features, raised his long knife, his eyes burning with determination.  The air crackled with anticipation, the threat palpable.
7.0.C.0.jpg;  A swift kick, a brutal impact, the man in brown boots launched his foot forward, connecting with his target with a violent force.
7.0.C.1.jpg; The man in the white mask tumbled through the air, his knife glinting in the dim light, his body wracked with pain.
7.0.D.jpg; "Euuaahhkk!"  the man on the ground screamed, his hand clutching at his injured foot.  "Aaahhkk! My foot!" he groaned, his pain echoing through the room. 
7.0.E.jpg; The man in the white mask, his eyes locked on his target, turned his head, his focus unwavering, his determination unwavering. 
7.0.F.0.jpg; A swift punch, a sharp crack, the man in the white mask connected with his target, the pain evident on the man with brown hair.
7.0.F.1.jpg; The man with brown hair lay on the ground, his body writhing in pain, the blow still echoing through his system. 
7.0.G.jpg; The two men, covered in white foam, lay there, their faces etched with shock and distress, their bodies still, their struggle over.
7.0.H.jpg; The young person with blue hair, their eyes wide with shock, gasped, "Huh.." The surprise was evident, their face a mix of disbelief and curiosity. 
7.0.I.jpg;  "To think he'd be this overwhelmingly powerful.....!" the woman whispered, her eyes wide with shock, her mouth agape in disbelief.  The man, his gun held steady, stood in the center of the room, a chilling aura surrounding him. 
7.0.J.jpg;  "You're drooling." the masked man stated. as he turned away. The woman, her eyes wide, her face flushed, wiped her mouth, clearly embarrassed.
7.0.K.jpg;  "Have a nice life." the masked man said. his back still turned to the viewer, "From now on, be careful when it comes to people."
7.0.L.jpg;  The woman watched him leave, her face etched with concern. "Uh, uh, I.....!" she stammered, her words trailing off as he disappeared into the crowd.
7.1.A.jpg;  "Thank, thank you! Hyung!"  she exclaimed, her hands raised in a gesture of gratitude. "I'll make sure that I become like you one day!"
7.1.B.jpg; The man walked away, his blue jeans and black sneakers barely making a sound as he disappeared into the distance.
7.1.C.jpg; "Visit the flower garden in Prezia." the man said. "Pardon?"  He looked around, confused. 
7.1.D.jpg;  "It'll be very helpful for you." he declared. his white mask concealing his expression. His confidence radiated through his every word. 
7.1.E.jpg;  The woman walked away, her steps hurried, her shoulders slumped, her expression a mix of worry and resignation.  
7.1.F.jpg;   "...He said the flower garden in Prezia, right?" he muttered, his fist clenched tight, his anger simmering just beneath the surface.
7.1.G.jpg;  The young man stood there, his gaze fixed on the horizon, his expression serious, his determination burning bright. The world around him seemed to fade away, replaced by a quiet intensity. 
7.1.H.jpg; The man with red hair sat on the ledge, his hands resting gently on the young boy's head, a somber silence hanging in the air. The man with white hair, his back to the viewer, clutched his wounded side, his expression grim. The body in the foreground lay still, a dark stain spreading across his green jacket.  
7.1.I.jpg;  "Oh!" the man with red hair exclaimed, his smile genuine, his carefree attitude radiating through his relaxed posture. 
7.1.J.jpg; "Would you look at that?" he chuckled, a mischievous smirk playing on his lips as his gaze lingered on something out of frame. 
7.1.K.jpg; The young man curled up on the ground, wincing in pain as a foot landed on his shoulder. "Hey, hey." the voice boomed, "Stop sleeping and get up." 
7.1.L.jpg;  The young man sat slumped against the wall, his arms crossed, a sigh escaping his lips. "Euhaaaahhh!" he groaned. "What is it again? I can't even sleep."
7.1.M.jpg; "Did you see what happened before?" the man with red hair asked, his eyes fixed on the young man with green hair.  "What?" he replied, his brow furrowed.  "Those guys who were raising their shoulders, flaunting that they were going to be accepted into Arangdan, they got played, no?"
7.2.A.jpg;  The young man with green hair leaned back, a sigh of relief escaping his lips. "We already expected that to happen after seeing them tactlessly raise their shoulders. I knew they would one day meet their match and get pummeled. They weren't really people who caught my eye anyway."
7.2.B.jpg;  "Huh?" The young man with green hair looked up, his eyes widening in surprise, his face a mix of disbelief and confusion. "By himself?" he asked. "He beat them by himself though?"
7.2.C.jpg; The man with red hair knelt down, a small smile gracing his lips. "He seemed like someone who cleared it as a solo player." he stated. "Really?" The young man with green hair looked up, his eyes widening. "Yeah. At Block A, on top of that." "At a time like this? He's amazing."
7.2.D.jpg;  The man with green hair, his face etched with worry, looked to the right. "But you said that he beat up some people from Arangdan. That probably means that those people in blue and white are going to throw a fit, aren't they? To be specific, he was just a candidate. Heiheiheiheih..." 
7.2.E.jpg;  "So that's why I was thinking, what do you think about teaming up with me?" the man with red hair said, his smile widening. "Him being a solo player means that he isn't affiliated with anyone. There is really no one like him!"
7.2.F.jpg; The man with green hair frowned, his eyes narrowed in thought.  "Well, I'm not sure about that. We might have to face those people in blue and white."
7.2.G.jpg; "Hah! Since when have you started worrying about something like that?" the man with red hair laughed, his hand resting on the hilt of his sword. "Hehe. That's true. Anywho, since I'm going to go make sure once more, do you want to come along?"
7.2.H.jpg; "Hyung, that's a bad hobby to have." the man with green hair said.
7.2.I.jpg; "So? You're not going to go?" the man with red hair teased, his smile widening. 
7.2.J.jpg;  "Impossi-ble." the man with green hair exclaimed, his eyes wide with disbelief.
7.2.K.jpg; "Don't you know that I like this sort of thing way more than you do?" the man with green hair said, his smile confident.
7.2.L.0.jpg;  The air crackled with anticipation. "Block B's trial will now begin. There are four passageways in Block B. Please select one and clear it."
7.2.L.1.jpg; The man with brown hair stood before the four doors, his eyes scanning each one, a sense of unease settling over him.  
7.3.A.jpg;  The blue door stood before them, its surface smooth and unyielding.  "My brother chose the blue door. The second to the right." 
7.3.B.jpg;  "I will choose the black door." he muttered, his eyes focused on the darkness ahead. "That is because, in Block B, the items that one can obtain vary depending on which colored door one chooses."
7.3.C.jpg;  "I must obtain Batori's Vampiric Dagger." he whispered, his eyes locked on the gleaming blade.  The dagger pulsed with a menacing red glow, its sharp edge promising a swift and brutal end.
7.3.D.jpg;  "!"  He roared. his white mask concealing his expression. 
7.3.E.jpg;   "You have entered the black route." a voice boomed. He stood at the edge of the pond, its dark blue surface reflecting the dim light.  "Cross the pond and successfully reach the other side safely."
7.3.F.jpg;  [Cheon Joong Soo's Pond], a serene body of water, its surface undisturbed.  "A pond that was created after the giant, Mimireu, accidentally spilled some water that he was transporting. The pond is inhabitable by living things."
7.3.G.jpg; The man, his frustration evident, kicked the rock across the floor, his anger simmering beneath the surface. 
7.3.H.jpg; The man stood, his white mask a stark contrast to the dark water, his eyes fixed on the splash, a hint of excitement flashing in them. 
7.3.I.jpg;  "I knew it!"  he exclaimed, his surprise evident.  The rock, its surface smooth and gray, moved through the water, a trail of bubbles trailing behind it.
7.3.J.jpg; He stood, his thoughts racing, his white mask concealing his worry.  "This water isn't normal. The density and water pressure of the pond water is incomparable to that of normal water. The average person will be crushed by this water."
7.4.A.jpg; The man walked, his shoulders slumped, his head bowed, his every step heavy with despair.  He had failed.  The world around him seemed to fade into a bleak canvas, reflecting the emptiness he felt within. 
7.4.B.jpg;  The man, his white mask a beacon of hope in the darkness, stepped out of the doorway, his backpack slung over his shoulder, a smile playing on his lips. He was ready for adventure, eager to embrace the unknown, his heart filled with a sense of freedom.
7.4.C.jpg;  "There we go." he muttered. as he stood in the doorway, his back to the viewer. He looked over his shoulder, his expression a mix of determination and uncertainty, his mind focused on the task ahead. 
7.4.D.jpg;  "You have acquired 300 credits." one box proclaimed, while the other one, "You have entered the dungeon." seemed to echo his own thoughts. He walked, his steps steady and purposeful, his eyes fixed on the path ahead, his mind clear and focused. 
7.4.E.jpg;  "I found it." he breathed, a wave of relief washing over him. His eyes, visible beneath the white mask, shone with a newfound confidence, a sense of accomplishment, as he gazed upon his discovery.
7.4.F.jpg; "White moss." he read, a hint of curiosity in his voice.  "A moss that finds its way into caves. It holds the spirit of the moon. One might contract a stomach ache if ingested. It also doesn't taste good."  He bent down, his eyes fixed on the moss, a sense of wonder filling him.
7.4.G.jpg;   "White moss is a miracle drug that possesses the spirit of the moon. That is why it is said that there are many animals that consider it a staple food source." he muttered, his face contorted in pain, his hands clutching his stomach.  The white moss, once a source of curiosity, had turned into a painful reminder of his mistake.
7.5.A.jpg;  The three boxes, their words stark against the black background, revealed a hidden truth. "That is why some players who discover the dungeon tend to avoid the white moss." the top box stated. "A secret that brother discovered in the distant future." the middle box proclaimed.  "Was that there was a way to ingest the white moss by using it as one of many ingredients." the bottom box concluded. 
7.5.B.0.jpg;  "Creatures like insects and animals that consider the white moss to be a staple food have evolved in a way that allows them to artificially emit heat from its bodies so that they can harness the energy of the moon." the words glowed above the image, a testament to the power of the moon and the mysterious nature of this world.  
7.5.B.1.jpg;  The centipede, its red body glistening in the moonlight, slithered through the forest, its segmented body a blur of motion. The dog, its silhouette a stark contrast against the darkness, watched in fear as the creature approached, its sharp mandibles glinting. "That type of heat emission starts from the heart and takes on the attributes of fire." 
7.5.C.jpg;  The man, his white mask obscuring his features, stood with his back to the viewer, his eyes closed, his thoughts focused. "The heart and moss, if I use both of them at the same time, the two different properties will synergistically work together making it a miracle drug that will strengthen my bones and muscles." 
7.5.D.jpg;  "A human's body is very flimsy." he mused, his gaze fixed on the giant centipede. "It can easily get sick, break, or tear." He stood next to the creature, dwarfed by its massive form.  
7.5.E.jpg;  "However, having a strong framework and durable muscles..." He trailed off, his mind racing.  "There is a way to transform my body like this, to make it easier for me to fight." he whispered, his eyes reflecting a flicker of determination.
7.5.F.jpg;  "To do that..."  He tightened his grip on the silver knife, his eyes gleaming with resolve. 
7.5.G.jpg;  He stood, his backpack slung over his shoulder, his white mask concealing his features, his posture radiating a fierce determination.
7.5.H.0.jpg; The centipede lay still, its red body a stark contrast against the darkness, a formidable creature.  "I need white moss and the heart of an animal to change my body." 
7.5.H.1.jpg; He stood, his hand outstretched, his expression unwavering, his confidence unshaken. " "  
8.0.A.0.jpg; "Red Centipede." the words echoed through the chamber, a warning of the danger that lurked within. 
8.0.A.1.jpg;  "A centipede that relies on the white moss as a staple food source. Although its eyes have atrophied due to the fact that it lives in a sea cave, its other senses are much more developed. It sometimes enjoys consuming meat instead of its usual moss."
8.0.B.jpg;  "[Hidden Quest / Frost and Fire]"  The words appeared before him, a challenge whispered in the darkness.  "Inside the room of frost and fire, there are peculiar monsters that rely on the white moss as a staple food source. If these monsters were to wander outside of the dungeon, there is a chance that the outside ecosystem will become chaotic. Please hunt down as many monsters as possible. Reward: Depending on the number of monsters hunted, the reward will differ."
8.0.C.jpg;  The creature, its red shell gleaming under the dim light, moved with a terrifying speed, its claws a blur of motion.  It was a predator, its every movement instinctual, its hunger a force of nature. 
8.1.A.jpg; The man dodged a large crab-like monster, its red shell shimmering in the dim light, as he sprinted towards the left. 
8.1.B.jpg;  He paused, his hand trembling slightly, the blade of his weapon cold against his palm. "It's too solid." he muttered, frustration creeping into his voice. 
8.1.C.jpg; "Normal attacks won't phase it. It's outer layer is extremely durable." read the text above him. "Even though the knife luckily pierced through it... it didn't penetrate deep enough. It would be irrational to try and take it out."  he read the text below. 
8.2.A.jpg;  "Since there is no way for me to find out what the red centipede's stamina level is, and as long as I don't know how deep this dungeon goes." the man's words echoed through the dimly lit cavern, "I need to clear this dungeon in a short amount of time."
8.2.B.jpg;  The man's golden eyes,  shining with an almost otherworldly glow, seemed to pierce the darkness. "Dragon eyes."  the text above read,  a hint of mystery in the air. 
8.2.C.jpg;  The red crab-like creature, a monstrous centipede with black eyes, moved with unsettling grace, its every stride radiating power and menace.
8.2.D.jpg;  The monster, its sharp claws glinting in the darkness, lunged towards the viewer.  "Found it."  a chilling message appeared below its sharp appendages. 
8.3.A.jpg;  The man stood firm,  his back to the viewer,  weapon gripped tightly in his hand,  facing the menacing red crab-like creature. He was ready for battle.  
8.3.B.jpg; "I need to stab it at exactly the right time." the man whispered, his focus unwavering as he planned his next move. 
8.3.C.0.jpg;  The massive creature, a crimson lobster with a jagged shell and outstretched claws, crouched on the floor, ready to unleash its fury. 
8.3.C.1.jpg; The creature, a menacing red lobster with jagged shell and sharp claws, hovered menacingly over the man,  its presence radiating danger. 
8.3.D.jpg;  The hunter, his arm resting on the red surface,  seemed to relax,  a sigh escaping his lips. 
8.4.A.jpg;  With his left hand resting on the creatures  shell, the hunter held a knife in his right hand,  his gaze focused and determined,  trying to keep the creature at bay. 
8.4.B.jpg;  He swung the knife,  his grip tight,  his black shirt straining as he prepared for the attack. 
8.4.C.0.jpg;  Surrounded by white energy blasts,  the mans eyes glowed,  a powerful surge of energy radiating outward. 
8.4.C.1.jpg;  The creature, pierced by a large object,  was lifted into the air, its legs thrashing in pain,  as the man's attack unleashed its force. 
8.5.A.jpg;  The knife, driven deep into the red surface,  struck the hunter's eye with surprise.  "An inner shell?!" he exclaimed. 
8.5.B.jpg; The hunter, his gaze focused,  his white mask concealing most of his face,  looked at something with shock and disbelief. 
8.5.C.jpg;  The red lobster,  its claws outstretched,  prepared to strike the man, who stood ready to fight.
8.6.A.0.jpg;  The man,  falling through the dark abyss,  his face set in determination,  looked ready to confront whatever awaited him below. 
8.6.A.1.jpg;  A large,  red object with black rings and spikes protruded from the darkness,  its menacing form instilling fear. 
8.6.B.jpg;  The man,  his face contorted in pain,  eyes wide,  mouth stained with blood,  looked utterly defeated.  "You have taken an extreme amount of damage. You are now stunned."  the text above read. 
8.7.A.jpg;  The man,  his black hoodie pulled tight,  his white mask obscuring his face,  stood before the wall.  "4 broken."  the text above him read,  "2 fractures on my spine."  the text below added. 
8.7.B.jpg;  The man, his white mask concealing his face,  stood before the wall,  his expression stoic.  "The vein in my left thigh is ruptured."  the text above read,  "Your 'cold blooded' nature will keep you composed."  the text below stated. 
8.7.C.jpg;  His hand gripped the knife,  strong and determined,  as the words above him declared,  "You are no longer poisoned. You have developed a tolerance to the poison."
8.8.A.0.jpg;  A red,  spiked monster lurked in the darkness.  "For someone who doesn't lose his composure in any situation,  you have deeply realized that you have endurance and iron will."  the message read. 
8.8.A.1.jpg;  The man,  his face pale with fear,  looked up at the large,  intimidating centipede,  its sharp teeth glinting in the dim light. 
8.8.B.0.jpg;   "You have learned the skill 'Will to Fight'."  the message above read,  its words a testament to the man's determination. 
8.8.B.1.jpg;  He plunged the knife into the red monster,  his focus unwavering,  his movements precise and deadly. 
8.8.C.jpg;  He stood,  his hand gripping the hilt of the sword,  his eyes a mixture of concern and determination,  ready to strike.  
8.9.A.jpg;  The man, his face partly hidden by the white mask,  ran frantically to the left,  trying to escape the large,  dark creature with red claws. 
8.9.B.jpg;  He stared intently at something,  his gaze focused,  "There is only one site above its joint where the hard shell isn't present."  he muttered. 
8.9.C.jpg; The hand,  cloaked in a black glove,  clenched tightly around the hilt of the knife,  ready to strike. 
8.9.D.jpg;  The hand,  surrounded by blue energy,  held the gun pointed towards the left,  "The abdomen."  the text read. 
8.9.E.jpg;  The man,  his sword piercing the creature's body,  his expression determined,  fought back with all his might. 
8.10.A.0.jpg;  The man's eyes widened in shock,  his face pale,  as he stared at something to the right.
8.10.A.1.jpg;  The blue liquid,  "squish"  it read below,  spilled out from a crack in the ground.  
8.10.B.jpg;   The dark cave entrance beckoned,  its shadowy depths hiding untold dangers.  
8.10.C.jpg;  He lay on the ground,  his knife clutched tightly in his hand,  his eyes wide with fear,  as the large,  red centipede hovered above him.
8.10.D.jpg;  The man,  his body limp,  his mask splattered with blue paint,  lay unconscious on the wooden floor.  
8.11.A.jpg; The monster's head,  its gaping maw revealing sharp teeth and a long,  pink tongue,  radiated a sense of primal terror.
8.11.B.0.jpg;  The man,  his face resolute,  removed his mask,  his eyes shining with determination.  "You have safely eliminated the red centipede. You have hunted something that is usually unable to be hunted. Additional rewards will be given." the text above read.  
8.11.B.1.jpg;  The wooden floor,  a dark brown expanse dotted with white stars,  exuded an aura of peace. 
8.11.C.jpg;  A hand,  pale and slender,  reached down to touch the wooden floor,  its long fingers tracing the white stars. 
8.12.A.jpg;  He clutched his hand to his mouth,  his eyes filled with worry,  his body trembling with anxiety.
8.12.B.jpg;  The man's torso,  surrounded by a blue aura,  five circles pulsing with energy,  radiated strength and power.
8.12.C.jpg;  He held the black knife in front of his face,  his expression somber,  "grrr.."  the text above his head whispered. 
8.12.D.jpg;  The blue liquid splashed across the dark brown background,  leaving behind a trail of destruction. 
8.12.E.jpg;  He held the blue glowing orb,  his gaze focused,  his hands steady,  "shh."  the text above him read. 
8.13.A.jpg;  The man,  his grey hair visible,  his face etched with confusion,  looked at something with bewilderment.  "Why are you both like this?"  the text above his head asked. 
8.13.B.jpg; The man with black hair, his cape billowing behind him, looked worried, his gaze fixed on his companion, who shared his concern. 
8.14.A.jpg; The man with dark grey hair, his hand on his hip, glared at the two men before him. "You mess with my food when I step out for just a little while?" he asked, annoyance evident in his voice. "I thought I recruited some fine men." he added, his tone laced with disappointment. 
8.14.B.jpg;  "This guy having the nerve to mess with them knowing that they are under Arangdan's protection can only mean..."  the man with dark grey hair muttered, his anger rising.  "That he really looks down on us." he finished, his expression one of disgust. 
8.14.C.jpg;  "You're saying it's someone who was wearing a white mask?" the man with dark grey hair asked.  "Yes, that is correct." the other man replied, his face etched with shock. 
8.14.D.jpg; "A mask you say." the man with dark grey hair mused, his hand on his chin, his expression thoughtful. 
8.15.A.jpg; The black boots, planted firmly on the white floor,  seemed to  suggest a  coming confrontation.  
8.15.B.jpg; The man with dark gray hair,  his gaze determined,  looked to his left,  "I'll just have to look for him for now." he said,  his tone resolute.  
8.15.C.jpg;  The man's eyes, dark and intense, radiated a dangerous aura.  
9.0.A.jpg;  The man,  his right hand coated in blue,  looked determined as he read the text above and below.  "You have hunted something that is usually unable to be hunted. Additional rewards will be given." the text above read.  "You have ingested the red centipede's heart."  the text below stated. 
9.0.B.jpg;  Three blue circles, glowing with a light blue hue, and three red circles, emitting a darker red glow, overlapped, creating a strange and beautiful pattern.  "It synergizes with the white moss to prompt a new hidden beneficial effect." the text to the right explained. 
9.0.C.jpg; The arm on the right, encased in a shining green and white striped metal cage,  radiated a bright light,  while the left arm,  shadowed and cracked,  was covered in a red and white striped cage.  "My broken bones are healed and stronger than before." the text above read.
9.0.D.jpg; The man,  his right arm exposed,  looked at his muscles,  now glowing red and defined.  "My torn muscles repair themselves and became more durable." the text below read.
9.1.A.jpg;  The man, his hoodie pulled up,  lay on his side,  exhausted,  his eyes closed,  his mouth slightly open. "You have obtained a clue for the 'heart of fire, crest of frost'." the text above read.  "Hoo." he breathed, falling asleep.
9.1.B.jpg;  The man's eyes, wide open, stared intently at something,  a look of concentration on his face. "A hidden piece that reinforces my body frame and muscles." the text above read. "The heart of fire and crest of frost are within reach." the text below continued. 
9.1.C.jpg;  He pointed at the blue digital screen, his left arm extended,  his focus unwavering.  "I've only progressed 1.5% for that quest,  but the rate at which my body recovers from fatigue is proportional to the rate at which my body becomes stronger."  the text above explained.
9.2.A.jpg; The character,  his stats displayed in a digital panel,  thought to himself, "Compared to clearing the boss room, I never thought that I would gain more stats from hunting one red centipede."  "Having low mp makes me a bit lacking. Is there nothing I can do about it right now?" he wondered. 
9.2.B.jpg; The man, his eyes glowing bright blue,  thought about his situation. "Depending on my skills will be okay for me now,  however,  there will be many instances in the future where I will need to use mana."  he concluded. 
9.2.C.jpg; The black dragon,  its orange eyes burning,  roared mightily.  "Most importantly, my ascension is not fully complete." the text above read.  "The dragon's body. The bump is part of the body so there is a special quality to it."  the text below continued.  "In order to completely accept the power that began with the ancient dragon Kalatz,  mana is essential."  the text concluded. 
9.2.D.jpg;  The man,  his gaze fixed on the blue digital screen,  considered his options. "Let's just keep an eye on it for the time being." he decided.  "Contemplating what to do about it doesn't mean the solution will present itself." he mused.
9.3.A.jpg;  "The effects of physical resistance are greatest in response to impact received externally." [Physical Resistance] Rating: E-Proficiency: 7.2% Resistance to physical attacks increases. High resistance to different status effects may occur situationally.  This skill minimizes impact and relieves pain." the text explained. 
9.3.B.jpg;  The man,  his white mask concealing his face,  looked shocked and scared,  his body tense with pain.  "My 'cold blooded' nature allowed me to stay conscious during training, but..." the text above him read. 
9.3.C.jpg;  The man,  his eyes determined,  stood in a fighting stance,  his expression grim.  "After suffering unbearable pain multiple times, it becomes incredibly difficult to keep up the will to stay conscious and endure." the text above read.  "If I properly use this skill, I will be able to avoid situations like that in the future."  the text below explained. 
9.3.D.jpg; The man,  his body limp,  lay unconscious on the ground,  his face pale and drawn.  "High resistance against poisoning, burns, frostbite, stuns, hallucinations, and curses is good too." the text above read.  "I may not have mastered it yet, but it is definitely a useful skill that can support my fighting style." the text below continued. 
9.4.A.jpg; The hand,  its finger pointing upwards,  seemed to  indicate a  new direction.  "Onto the next one."  the text below read.  
9.4.B.0.jpg;  The blue head,  a lightning bolt swirling within,  radiated seriousness.  "Being able to quickly make decisions in tense situations may be an important key to saving a life, but it could also be a critical loss that could end up with a lost life." the text above read.  "This is the most important." the text below emphasized.
9.4.B.1.jpg;  The blue silhouette,  its long hair flowing behind it,  stood tall and strong. "Even in my fight against the red centipede, I was able to win because of this skill." the text below declared.
9.4.C.jpg; The young man,  his black hoodie pulled up,  smiled confidently.  "The rating that both skills received aren't all that bad." he said. "Because getting a D+ rating in the tutorial is not an easy feat." the text to the right added.
9.4.D.jpg;  The man,  his face hidden behind the white mask,  looked dejected.  He tried to hide his emotions, but his sadness was evident. 
9.5.A.jpg; The two bats,  their wings spread wide,  flew towards the viewer,  their sharp teeth bared.  "Keeekeeeek!"  the sound effect echoed above them,  "Keeekeek!"  the sound continued below.
9.5.B.jpg;  The person's feet,  planted firmly on the ground,  stood above the defeated bat,  its wings sprawled out,  its body lifeless.  "Number of monsters hunted: 147." the text above read.  
9.6.A.jpg; The man, his white mask concealing his face,  held a large, curved, brown object in his left hand,  his expression neutral.  "I'm getting used to things now." the text above him read. 
9.6.B.jpg; A hand,  its palm open,  held two sharp, white claws,  "The teeth and toenails of the infrasonic bats."  the text above read.
9.6.C.jpg; A glass bottle, containing a blue liquid,  sat on a table. "A mixture of the white moss and the incredibly poisonous blood of the red centipede." the text above read, "will be mixed together at a certain ratio to prepare a solution." the text below explained. 
9.6.D.jpg; A hand poured the blue liquid from the bottle onto a pile of brown, gray, and white objects.  "If I pour this solution over teeth and toenails of the infrasonic bats."  the text above read,  as the objects glowed blue.
9.7.A.jpg; The glowing blue objects,  emitting smoke,  radiated power and a sense of impending destruction.  
9.7.B.jpg; The brown powder,  "It becomes a monster powder with fire type attributes."  the text above explained.  "If you ignite it,  it will set off a hefty explosion." the text below warned. 
9.7.C.jpg; A hand, holding a bag,  poured brown powder out,  its movements swift and purposeful. 
9.7.D.jpg;  The man,  his backpack slung across his shoulders,  stood confidently,  his bag in hand. 
9.7.E.jpg; The man,  his face obscured by the white mask,  stood with a serious expression,  "The next thing is." the text above read,  his eyes focused on the task ahead. 
9.8.A.0.jpg;  The man,  his dark top visible,  watched as the blue ants crawled on the wall, his expression one of awe. 
9.8.A.1.jpg;  The wall,  made of wood,  was teeming with blue ants,  some crawling on top of the oval-shaped pods,  some scurrying between them,  and others clinging to the surface.
9.8.B.jpg;  A large blue ant,  its body gleaming like metal,  prepared to lift a large, oval-shaped pod.  "Blue army ants."  the text above read,  "grow to become anywhere between 30 cm to 1 m in size.  With the queen ant at its center, hundreds of ants gather to form its own society." 
9.8.C.jpg;  The man,  his white mask concealing his face,  looked down at the two giant ants with concern.  "One characteristic of the ant society is that the worker ants are willing to give up their lives in order to protect their habitat."  the text above read.  "Must I go against hundreds of them who will be coming at me at once?"  the man wondered.
9.9.A.jpg;  The man,  his face obscured by the white mask,  stood in the dark hallway,  his expression filled with worry.  "The problem is that the room beyond here has Batori's vampiric dagger." he thought.  
9.9.B.0.jpg;  The woman, her red eyes burning with malice,  stood amidst the chaos and destruction.  "I think she was known to suck out the life force of others in order to grow stronger, and if allowed to continue, would also rob you of your skills which would cause massive devastation?"  the text above read.  "There are still players and clans who feel miserable when thinking about all of the damage they had suffered from her."  the text below continued. 
9.9.B.1.jpg; The silver dagger,  its black handle gleaming,  lay on a red surface.  "The lower the number is on an artifact, the more exceptional it is."  the text above read.  "Because the dagger is from a being of that caliber,  the numbering on the dagger is extremely low."  the text continued.  "[Batori's Vampire Dagger] Artifact Number: 352."  the text below identified it.  "It's a three digit number, and since it's in the 300s, it's a top tier artifact."  the text added. "On top of that,  it's a unique item that's one of it's kind in the whole tower and tutorial."  it concluded. 
9.10.A.jpg;  The man, his face hidden by the white mask,  looked determined. "I cannot lose out on this." he declared.  "If I can't attack them head on,  I'll just have to use a little trick." he mused.  
9.10.B.jpg;  The man,  his black hoodie pulled up,  walked confidently,  his right hand holding something. 
9.10.C.jpg;  The man,  his legs pumping,  ran swiftly,  his weapon secured at his hip. 
9.10.D.jpg;  The two blue ants,  standing in the dark cave,  looked surprised and confused.  "?."  the text above them read. 
9.10.E.jpg;  He moved forward, his focus unwavering, a dark figure in the shadows. 
9.11.A.jpg;  A small blue ant, alone in the cavern, scrabbled up onto a white rock, its antennae twitching.
9.11.B.jpg; The hand, calm and collected, flicked the lighter open, a small flame igniting in the darkness. 
9.11.C.jpg;  He sprinted through the darkness, a black blur carrying a large bag on his back. 
9.12.A.0.jpg;  In the depths of the cave, a battle raged. A red ant, its jaws bared, attacked a smaller blue one. 
9.12.A.1.jpg; The red ant lunged forward, its mandibles snapping shut. "Ah!" The blue ant cried out, struggling to defend itself. 
9.12.B.jpg; A roaring inferno erupted, engulfing everything in its path. "You have successfully blown up the ant tunnel." a message declared. "217 blue army ants have died by explosion, 89 blue army ants have been burned."
9.12.C.jpg; He stood triumphantly, a sword protruding from his arm, a fiery inferno behind him.  "Additional karma will be given." a voice whispered. 
9.13.A.0.jpg;  He turned his head, eyes widening in disbelief, the fire reflecting in his masked face. 
9.13.A.1.jpg; The blue monster, crushed and defeated, lay on the ground, its form contorted in agony. 
9.13.B.jpg;  The masked figure stood over the terrified monster, sword raised, a look of fierce determination on his face.
9.13.C.jpg;  He stood near the lifeless monster, a sense of sadness washing over him. "Among those that died, there were baby ants as well as eggs that were preparing to hatch." he muttered, a heavy weight in his heart. 
9.14.A.jpg; He stood in the darkness, pondering the situation. "There are still a lot of worker ants left." he thought, his gaze fixed on the horizon. 
9.14.B.jpg;  He leaned against a wall, his mind racing. "I can work on these critters after I get my hands on Batori's vampiric dagger." he whispered to himself.
9.14.C.jpg; He stood in the shadows, a grim expression on his face. "The immediate danger." he thought, "but what about the long-term consequences?"
9.14.D.jpg;  He stood frozen, his eyes wide with terror, a wave of fear washing over him. 
9.14.E.jpg;  He stood on the wooden floor, every muscle tense, anticipation building in the air. 
9.15.A.jpg; The man stood before the monstrous silhouette, its glowing red eyes piercing the darkness, his own heart pounding with fear.
9.15.B.jpg; The blue monster, its wings scorched and singed, thrashed in agony, enveloped in flames. 
9.15.C.jpg; The giant insect, a monstrous creature of blue and purple, stood against the red and orange desert, a formidable foe.  
9.15.D.jpg;  He stood poised, knife in hand, a figure of quiet intensity in the smoky darkness. "Swoosh." a sound whispered in the air.  
9.15.E.jpg; A shadowed figure, cloaked in darkness, its eyes burning with a malevolent glow, emerged from the shadows. 
9.16.A.0.jpg; The giant insect, its exoskeleton a deep blue, stood in a defensive stance, its front legs raised, a red "ouch" hovering above it.  
9.16.A.1.jpg; He turned, a shadow against the backdrop of the colossal insect, its dark blue exoskeleton filling the frame. "Boss monster, queen blue army ant has appeared." a message flashed, a sense of urgency and danger gripping the scene. 
10.0.A.0.jpg; The giant blue creature, its legs twitching in pain, writhed on the ground.
10.0.A.1.jpg; The man, his face etched with fear and concern, stared at the massive blue creature. "Boss monster, queen blue army ant has appeared." a message flashed, a chilling confirmation of the danger they faced.  
10.0.B.jpg; The large blue creature with six legs stood before them, its presence radiating fear and anger. 
10.0.C.jpg; He stood, knife in hand, ready for a fight, his determination a stark contrast to the menacing atmosphere. 
10.0.D.jpg; He walked deeper into the tunnel, its walls a blend of brown, orange, and white, a sense of mystery and intrigue clinging to the air. "There should be a door somewhere inside this ant tunnel." a thought echoed in his mind.  
10.1.A.jpg; The man stood frozen, his eyes wide with shock, the blue insect in the background, surrounded by swirling orange flames, a terrifying spectacle. "If the other hunters get to it first, our profits would dwindle." he thought, a wave of anxiety washing over him.  
10.1.B.jpg;  The blue insect, legs extended, moved through the darkness, its path illuminated by orange flames.  "Found it." a voice whispered. 
10.1.C.jpg;  He stood, his hand holding three black objects, a determined glint in his eye.  
10.1.D.jpg;  He stood, fist clenched, ready to strike, his determination unwavering. 
10.2.A.jpg; The blue insect, its legs blurred in motion, darted through the darkness, fear and worry etched on its face. 
10.2.B.0.jpg;  He stood, a black object clutched in his hand, his gaze fixed on it.  Below him, the blue insect lay on its back, legs outstretched, red glowing orbs on each leg, a look of terror on its face.  
10.2.B.1.jpg;  He sprinted, the blue insect in hot pursuit, its anger palpable.  
10.2.C.0.jpg; The blue insect, legs long and sharp, moved with a menacing aggression, its speed a blur in the darkness. 
10.2.C.1.jpg; The blue insect, legs extended, moved with a terrifying ferocity, its movements sharp and dangerous.  
10.3.A.jpg; The man raced through the darkness, his heart pounding with fear, the two giant blue insects behind him, their aggression evident in every step.
10.3.B.jpg;  The hand, gripped tightly around the wooden pole, propelled the figure forward, a sense of urgency and force driving its movement.  
10.3.C.0.jpg;  The green vase, perched atop the platform, emitted blue flames, a mysterious and powerful energy radiating from it. "You have entered 'the shrine of the vampiric monarch'." a voice whispered. 
10.3.C.1.jpg;  The vase stood in a large, red-walled room, the black and white checkered floor reflecting the dim light, a sense of mystery and power filling the air. 
10.4.A.0.jpg;  She stood, a woman with long, snake-like hair, her eyes sharp, fangs bared, a sword held in her hand, a fierce and powerful presence. "The vampiric monarch, Batori." a voice declared.
10.4.A.1.jpg;  A hand gripped the blue blade tightly, its energy glowing brightly. "So is that, the vampiric monarch's beloved weapon, the vampiric dagger?" a thought whispered. 
10.4.B.jpg;  He smiled, his eyes gleaming. "I have finally found it." he exclaimed, a sense of triumph filling his words. "Batori's vampiric dagger is the hidden piece that will substantially reduce the gap between me and the front runner."
10.4.C.0.jpg;  He pondered, his masked face a canvas of thought. "Overall, in addition to its striking power being noticeably good, and even if it only gives the opponent a 'bleed' status due to its 'blood mark' option, the dagger can provide an above average performance." 
10.4.C.1.jpg;  He walked, a confident smile on his face. "However, this artifact's real worth lies within the last option of the dagger which is currently sealed."
10.5.A.jpg;  Her gaze was fierce, her snake-like hair framing her face, a sense of power and danger radiating from her.
10.5.B.jpg; He stood, his masked face a picture of sadness, disappointment etched in his features.  
10.5.C.jpg; The hand, clad in a black glove, gripped the red weapon tightly, its curved blade pointed towards the bottom right corner. The air crackled with tension, a sense of foreboding hanging heavy in the air.  
10.5.D.jpg;  He stood, a figure of menace in the darkness, his blue glowing knife held in a ready position, his black swirls adding to his intimidating aura.  
10.5.E.jpg;  He stood, his eyes wide with worry, a sense of anxiety and fear radiating from him. "Batori's dagger chooses its wielder." a voice whispered. "If one is not chosen, it is said that your mind will become consumed by it." 
10.6.A.0.jpg;  He pondered, his masked face shrouded in shadow. "Would players who just entered the tutorial have enough skill to control the vampiric dagger?" a thought echoed. "My brother was able to figure out how new players could control the vampiric dagger through extensive research."
10.6.A.1.jpg;  He stood, a figure of quiet menace, the blue glowing knife held in his hand, his focus unwavering.  
10.6.B.jpg;  He reached out, his hand extended towards the darkness, fingers spread apart, a sense of mystery and intrigue hanging in the air. "If other people saw me do this, they would say I'm crazy." a thought crossed his mind. 
10.6.C.jpg;  The hand, clad in black, gripped the blue glowing knife, its red handle a stark contrast against the dark setting.  A sense of menace hung in the air.  
10.7.A.jpg;  He stood, his hand gripping the blue glowing knife, his expression serious, his determination palpable.  
10.7.B.jpg;  He reached out, his hand open, fingers spread, a sense of mystery and intrigue filling the air. "Batori's vampiric dagger was actually the name of a skill." a voice revealed. "An incredibly difficult one at that."
10.7.C.jpg;  He stood, his hand marred by dark, bubbling spots, a sense of mystery and intrigue filling the air. "The vampiric monarch was so greedy that she didn't want to pass on her beloved weapon to someone else even after her death." a voice revealed. "So she sealed the dagger's true form and abilities and left it with the world." 
10.7.D.jpg;  He stood, his arm reaching out, his masked face a picture of determination. "The seal has been lifted." a voice boomed. "And it is only now that the seal has been lifted."  
10.8.A.jpg;  A hand reached out, its fingers closing around a red, jagged object.  "[Batori's vampiric dagger, true form] numbering 66 proficiency: 0.0%." a message flashed. "Description: The true form of the vampiric monarch's beloved weapon. It is said that it drains the life force of its opponents and devours their souls." "So this is the vampiric dagger." a voice whispered.
10.8.B.jpg;  "*Blood mark. When dealt a lethal blow, the target will be inflicted with 'bleed', which will drain a portion of the target's stamina and mana. The target will also receive additional damage over time which is a percentage of the initial damage received." A message popped up. "A unique skill that even the current highest rankers of the tower cannot easily get their hands on!" 
10.8.C.jpg;  He stood, his face a picture of shock, his eyebrows raised, his mouth slightly open. "*The vampiric monarch's authority."  A message appeared. "The target's vital force is drained to the core and a portion of the target's ability is stolen as well. In the case that the skill is fully mastered, at a fixed probability, there is a chance that the target's skill could be completely stolen."
10.8.D.jpg;  He stood, his leg planted firmly on the ground, a large dark figure with jagged teeth beneath his foot. "Then, shall I go have my fill?" a voice echoed, a sense of power and dominance radiating from him.
10.9.A.jpg;  The large blue ant, legs outstretched, soared through the air, a sense of power and intensity filling the scene.
10.9.B.jpg;  He stepped, his black shoe crushing the back of the large blue ant, the creature struggling beneath his foot.  
10.9.D.jpg;  He stood, a determined look on his face, his dagger held in his hand, a sense of danger and excitement filling the air. 
10.10.A.jpg;  He ran, a blur of black, his dagger held in his hand, his face a picture of determination.  
10.10.B.jpg; He rode, the blue creature a blur of motion, his grip tight on its back, a sense of urgency and danger filling the air. 
10.10.C.jpg;  He struggled, a chain wrapped around his arm, a red glow illuminating the pain etched on his face. 
10.10.D.jpg;  He rode, the dark blue creature thrashing beneath him, its red eyes glowing fiercely, a sense of danger and power filling the air.
10.11.A.jpg;  He stood, his masked face a picture of coldness and danger. "Eat." a voice whispered. 
10.11.B.jpg;  The creature, its black and blue form engulfing the red hand, its large black mouth open, a sense of struggle and fear filling the scene. "The target's life force and vital force are being extracted." a message flashed. 
10.11.C.jpg;  The creature moved, its black and grey form a menacing presence. "The Batori's vampiric dagger skill level has gone up. 1.1%." a message declared.
10.12.A.jpg; The creature lay, dead and defeated, its legs spread out, a trail of black marking its final moments. "You have hunted the boss monster, queen blue army ant." a message declared. "Additional karma will be given." "You have received 300 karma." another message confirmed.  
10.12.B.jpg;  He stood, his arm covered in a dark substance, the blue ants in the foreground, the flames on the ground a testament to the battle fought. "The blue army ants' fighting spirit is dwindling." a voice whispered.  
10.13.A.jpg; The darkness stretched before them, a textured brown surface, a few white sparkles dancing in the air. "Euuum? Was there ever a place like this?" a voice wondered. "At least he's able to find places like this." another voice replied.  
10.13.B.jpg; He stood, a concerned look on his face, the woman behind him, her hand on her face, mirroring his doubt. "Hey! Are you sure this is the right place?" he asked.  "That's what I've been saying. If you don't believe me, shall we just head back?" she replied. 
10.13.C.jpg; He stood, a wide smile on his face, his hand on the shoulder of the man with green hair. "Ehhyi. Did anyone say we actually should? Why are you so hard to get close to?" he asked, a teasing tone in his voice. 
10.13.D.jpg;  He stood, his eyes wide with concern, a small frown creasing his brow. "Anyway." he muttered, a sense of doubt hanging in the air.
10.13.E.jpg;  He stood, explaining something to the man with green hair, a sense of danger and mystery filling the scene. "This guy relentlessly hunted these things." he said, gesturing towards the large red bugs scattered on the ground. 
10.14.A.jpg;  He stood, a small smile playing on his lips, looking down at the man with green hair. "He's amazing. How did he grow so strong so quickly?" he asked. "I don't think the monsters suddenly got weaker either."  "Yeah, it's a little funny to say this after only looking at the aftermath, but the ones he previously faced were arguably strong, if not stronger, than the ones he faced later, but they were definitely not weaker than the most recent ones."  
10.14.B.jpg; He stood, a confused expression on his face, a sense of uncertainty and doubt hanging in the air. 
10.14.C.jpg; He stood, a worried expression on his face, looking to the right, the man with green hair standing beside him, a confused look on his face. "Hyung." the man with green hair said.  "Yeah, I know. I don't think this is something we can take lightly." the man with pink hair replied. 
10.15.A.jpg; He stood, a surprised expression on his face, looking to the right, the man with green hair beside him, looking down with a worried expression. "Energy drain, you say. Just where did he find out something like that? When we tirelessly researched, nothing like this came up." he exclaimed.  "Was there a hidden piece in a place like this?" the man with green hair wondered. "Not only did he solo block A, but to think he is a player who also got hold of an artifact or skill in a hidden piece..." he continued. 
10.15.B.jpg; He stood, his hand on his chin, a worried expression on his face. "Someone like him is incredibly difficult to come by. Word is probably going to spread soon enough and rumors will start to circulate within the tutorial." he said. "If that happens, many clans will try and recruit him. We need to send him our way and win him over before all of this happens."
10.15.C.jpg; He stood, a surprised expression on his face, looking to the right, the man with green hair beside him, looking to the left, a confused expression on his face. 
10.15.D.jpg; He stood, his face filled with fear and apprehension, the man with green hair beside him, his eyes wide with surprise. 
10.16.A.jpg;  The man with pink hair, his concern evident, spoke to the man with green hair, who simply replied with a blank expression, "huh." a sense of tension filling the air.  
10.9.C.jpg; The massive blue ant, legs outstretched, hangs suspended in the air, its powerful form poised for action. 
1.0.A.jpg; If the other hunters get to it first, our profits would dwindle.
1.0.B.0.jpg; He smiles as he stands in front of a white tower, a blue sky behind him.
1.0.B.1.jpg; The man stares thoughtfully at a picture frame.
1.0.C.jpg; Three years ago, my mother, who already knew about his illness, spent the rest of her life trying to find my brother who disappeared.
1.0.D.jpg; A man in a black suit rips a paper off a stack, smiling as he does.
1.0.E.jpg; The man in military uniform stands in a hallway, his face impassive.
1.1.A.jpg; I gave up on trying to find my little brother and left Korea because I volunteered to be dispatched to Africa.
1.1.B.0.jpg; The man sits at a table, staring down at a book, a feeling of boredom and tiredness emanating from him.
1.1.B.1.jpg; The moment your brother was discovered, these were the articles he was hugging.
1.1.C.jpg; ...was he shooting a movie...? 
1.1.D.jpg; ... a pocketwatch?
1.1.E.jpg; ... this, was the present I gave him to wish him good luck on his college entrance exam.
1.1.F.jpg; Oh! Now that I think about it, I actually needed a watch.
1.2.A.jpg; Thanks, Hyung.
1.2.B.0.jpg; What? Damn! Give it to me.
1.2.B.1.jpg; Come on, what for. Forget it. I'll just carry it around.
1.2.C.jpg; If there is ever a time I need to write my name, I can just write it as cah.
1.2.D.jpg; Huh? Wasn't it broken?
1.2.E.jpg; To my brother who will hold this journal one day. 
1.2.F.jpg; The man walks quickly, his face filled with distress. 
1.3.A.0.jpg; By the time you are holding this, I will most likely not be a part of this world anymore.
1.3.A.1.jpg; But there is nothing installed on the clock.
1.3.B.0.jpg; I'm sorry. You had a hard time because of me, didn't you?
1.3.B.1.jpg; I thought I would be able to go back really soon, but I ended up drifting away like this.
1.3.D.jpg; I received a strange text message.
1.3.E.jpg; Normally I would have ignored it, but my emaciated mother in the hospital room caught my eye.
1.3.F.jpg; This is definitely not a dream! I'm certain. It was reality.
1.3.G.jpg; At the center of all of that was the sun god's tower, rumors even said that if you surpass the obelisk, you will become a god yourself.
1.3.H.jpg; However, my interest was in the all cure medicine that was located inside the tower in the form of an elixir.
1.3.I.0.jpg; I formed a team with like-minded people and started to climb the tower. 
1.3.I.1.jpg; I've decided to run away from home... I'll probably only have to struggle for half a year. With that, I cut off my connection to the real world.
1.4.A.0.jpg; Our team's name is now 'Artia.' Artia was the best in all aspects.
1.4.A.1.jpg; Our rate of conquest is slower than expected, so it will probably take another year... A conflict has arisen with a high ranking clan... our rate of conquest has encountered an obst...
1.4.B.0.jpg; ... 2, 20... an opposing clan we allied with has been destro...ed. I have someone I lov...
1.4.B.1.jpg; The man contemplates the events that have transpired, his face etched with a deep thought and contemplation.
1.4.C.jpg; The man and woman stand ready for battle, surrounded by flames. 
1.4.D.0.jpg; The war is still ongo... everyone is exhaus... A traitor has emerged. There is discord within the clan. Everyone is starting to get suspicious of each other.
1.4.D.1.jpg; My body is getting heavier. I was an addict.
1.4.E.0.jpg; ... 30. I miss you Hyung. I am the only one who remains in Atria. Where did things start to go wrong? I now possess the elixir, but I am unable to send it home because I am surrounded by enemies.
1.4.E.1.jpg; It was then that I knew. There is only one person in the world who is on my side. However, I cannot show these people that I am weak.  
1.5.A.0.jpg; I'm sure that if you listen to all of this, you will get the elixir and deliver it to mom, Hyung.
1.5.A.1.jpg; The man sits on the couch, clutching the chain in his hand, his face etched with sadness and despair.
1.5.B.jpg; To my brother who will hold this journal one day, if you...
1.5.C.jpg; I hope you will listen to these entries one day...
1.5.D.0.jpg; Succession commencing. Mana. Is this the power that the tower and those in the other world possess?
1.5.D.1.jpg; The man stares up, his face streaked with confusion and surprise.
1.6.A.jpg; To my brother who will listen to this one day...
1.6.B.0.jpg; The man kneels on the ground, his armor stained with tears, his face a mask of sadness and defeat.
1.6.B.1.jpg; A bloody sword pierces the center of the panel, a stark symbol of danger and violence.
1.6.C.0.jpg; The man stares down, his face smeared with blood, anger and sadness swirling in his eyes. 
1.7.A.jpg; The man in the dark room sat tensely in his chair, his eyes glued to the television screen. "Huh." he muttered, startled by the blue screen that now filled the television. 
1.7.B.jpg; The screen blinked, displaying a message in bold blue lettering: "Your body's ability has partially advanced. Your nature has been discovered. Your skills have been added." Below it, another screen displayed a profile with the name "Cha Hyun-woo" and the title "Cold Blooded" alongside a list of stats. 
1.7.C.jpg; A hand, gripping a pocket watch tightly, hovered over a picture of a man with dark hair. "Now I know exactly what happened to my brother." the hand whispered, "I now know why someone led him to death and why he came back to me like this in 5 years." 
1.7.D.0.jpg; The man, his intense eyes blazing white with a small pink ring around the pupil, glared into the darkness. "If that's the case." he growled, "I need to avenge him."
1.7.D.1.jpg; The man's hand, clenched around a silver object, emerged from a dark blue jacket. "By following the rules of that world." he warned. "I will do the same to you all."
2.0.A.jpg; The man, seated in his chair, stared intently at the screen in front of him. "Is this what they call the 'status window'?" he wondered aloud, "This really feels like a game." He stroked his chin, his brow furrowed in confusion. "Hmm." he mused, "After completing my awakening, it said that my body would adjust accordingly, but my abilities are still very lacking." 
2.0.B.jpg; The silhouette of a head, a bright blue brain pulsating with energy within, hovered before him.  "My nature isn't bad at all." the voice resonated, "Nature: Cold Blooded. You will always exhibit an unrelenting rationale in any situation. You are completely immune to anything along the lines of mind control like denouncement or brain-washing."
2.0.C.jpg; A fierce black dragon, its orange eye burning with power, loomed within a circle of white and yellow energy.  "Dragon visual prowess." the text above the dragon proclaimed, "The dragon's eyes. It penetrates even the truth. You are able to preview a portion of a person or object's ability beforehand." Below the dragon, another line of text read: "Jung-woo said that he met the ancient dragon, Calatuz and formed a contract with him on the 11th floor. Is this what's left of it?"
2.0.D.jpg; A swirling blue energy encompassed an eye, an ear, a nose, a hand, and a mouth. "[Heightened senses]" the text above declared, "Your five senses heightened drastically."  "I believe I was given heightened senses because it works well with my nature." the text below explained. 
2.0.E.0.jpg; The man, his eyes closed,  stood in contemplation, his expression a mixture of wonder and apprehension. "But the one that really caught my attention was the last one." he murmured.  "Because it was, clairvoyance." 
2.0.E.1.jpg; A hand, holding a silver pocket watch with Roman numerals, hovered over the text: "It's probably because of this, right?" The room was dark, the mood heavy with concern. 
2.0.F.0.jpg; The man, his dark hair a silhouette against the dim light, turned away, a sense of resignation settling over him. "Alright." the text above him read, "Let's go along with it for now."
2.0.F.1.jpg; The man, wearing a black jacket, sat slumped on the couch, his right hand resting on a chain. His serious expression reflected the somber and uncertain mood of the room.
2.0.G.jpg; The man's face, visible through a framed picture, stared forward with a hint of suspicion. "I feel like you just want me to find the elixir and quietly disappear." the text below read, "But I don't think I could just do that." The image, cast in a dark tone, exuded distrust. 
2.0.H.0.jpg; The city, bathed in the dusky light of twilight, pulsed with tension.  "Look here, Sergeant Cha!" the text shouted from the center of the scene, "What are you talking about?"
2.0.H.1.jpg; The man, wearing a black jacket and backpack, walked away from the viewer, his phone pressed to his ear. "You want to have dinner together all of a sudden?" the text asked, the image shrouded in a cloak of suspense.
2.1.A.jpg; A hand, its finger pressing on a phone screen, hovered over the text: "Cain' is, well if I turn here then how... I'm sorry."  The darkness of the scene amplified the somber tone of the words. 
2.1.B.jpg;  The man, wearing a black jacket and a backpack, looked down at the ground. "With that, have I settled all of my affairs." the text above him read.  Below him, another line proclaimed, "I put my house up for sale and I burned my military uniform as well as my backpack." The city scene, shrouded in a dark and moody atmosphere, seemed to echo his decision. 
2.1.C.jpg;  A black bag lay at the bottom of the image, two knives positioned above it. "I bought a brand new backpack and packed it with a couple articles of clothing, some rations." the text above explained. "Some knives that were identical to the ones I used in the unit, and a first aid kit." the text below completed the thought. The image, cloaked in a dark and mysterious feel, suggested a journey into the unknown. 
2.1.D.jpg; The man, his black jacket and baseball cap blending into the shadows, looked down, his face etched with a thoughtful expression.  "I wanted to get a gun or some explosives from the black market." the text above him stated.  "But if I cannot continuously supply myself with more magazines, it will only be a hassle." the text above his head finished. The image, dark and somber, revealed a man wrestling with difficult choices. 
2.1.E.1.jpg; The man, clad in black, walked along the path, his gaze fixed on the trees ahead. "Has the first round been going on for about a week now?" the text above his head mused. His steps were slow, his mind contemplative. 
2.2.A.jpg;  The trees rustled in the park, their branches reaching towards the sky.  A line of text explained the game's rules: "Players who start late are given an advantage based on how late he/she starts. The closer one gets to surpassing the front runner, the more points one can accumulate, and there is also a hidden piece that newcomers can take advantage of." 
2.2.B.jpg; The man, his black hat casting a shadow over his face, examined the black object with a wary gaze.  "And 'that thing' should be appearing right about now." the text above his head noted, a sense of suspense hanging in the air. 
2.2.C.jpg; The darkness, punctuated only by the rustling of leaves, held its breath, a tension palpable in the silence. 
2.2.D.0.jpg; The darkness pulsed with an intensity that thrummed beneath the surface.
2.2.D.1.jpg; The man, his black jacket and hat a stark contrast against the grassy expanse, looked up at the swirling black object, a mixture of fear and awe etched on his face. The image throbbed with anxiety. 
2.2.E.0.jpg; The large black gate, looming against the backdrop of trees, cast a long shadow over the park, the air thick with unease and anticipation. 
2.2.E.1.jpg; The black gate, sinking into the ground, its outline a stark silhouette against the green grass, seemed to whisper of an unknown and unsettling future. 
2.2.F.jpg; A bright space, radiating confidence, held the promise of victory. "I'm going to let those who are on the other side know." the text declared, "who they were messing with." 
2.2.G.jpg; The man, his black jacket and hat a familiar sight, stood in the grassy field, his gaze fixed on a point in the distance. "From today onwards." the text whispered, his mind focused on a decision, a new path ahead. 
2.3.A.jpg; The man, his face set with determination, emerged from the darkness, a bright light illuminating his path.  He was in a shadowy entryway, the walls a muted grey and brown, the air thick with mystery. 
2.3.B.0.jpg; A black shape, the outline of a foot, was the only thing visible in the dark room. Above it, a white text with an exclamation mark! A blue rectangle with white text announced, "You've entered floor 0 where the tutorial begins." Above it, Korean text proclaimed the beginning of a new chapter. The image pulsed with suspense, hinting at the start of a grand adventure.
2.3.B.1.jpg; The man, his black hoodie and cap pulled low, shielded his eyes as he surveyed the landscape.  Lines of light radiated outwards, a grey and white backdrop to his determined face.  "Ok." the text declared, his confidence radiating from the image. 
2.3.C.jpg; The man, his dark hair framing a serious face, closed his eyes, a sound effect echoing the intensity of his contemplation. The image conveyed a sense of quiet, focused thought. 
2.3.E.jpg; The man, his black hoodie and cap concealing his features, walked down the long, dark tunnel, its rough stone walls punctuated by bright blue lights.  "This place is exactly the same as what I saw in the journal." the text above him whispered. His expression reflected curiosity and intrigue. 
2.3.F.jpg; Six figures stood before a tall, dark tower, its purple glow casting a haunting light over the scene.  "The tower was an entrance exam for players that gave them the chance to become a god." the text above them explained. "In order to climb the tower, one must prove that he/she is qualified to do so. The place that tests if one is qualified is the tutorial." the text below added.  The characters, silhouetted against the tower,  radiated excitement and anticipation.  
2.3.G.jpg; The red sword, gleaming brightly in the dark red room, pulsed with a dangerous energy.  "Beyond this place is where the people who hurt Jung-woo are." the text above it warned, its message ominous and chilling. 
2.3.H.jpg;  The man, his face covered in blood, looked down with a mixture of sadness and determination.  "Just wait for me a little." the text beside him pleaded, "I'll be there soon."  His armor, a testament to his strength, shimmered in the dark room,  his expression a blend of hope and resolve.
