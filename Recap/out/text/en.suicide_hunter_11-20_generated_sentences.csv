11.1.A.0.jpg; A large green humanoid with red eyes and fangs raises his arm to attack. "now, now! if you don't want to get fucked, release your aura!"
11.1.A.1.jpg; Behind a concerned man in a red jacket, the drooling humanoid looms over him. "someone like you needs to train by experiencing it firsthand!"
11.1.B.jpg;  The man in the red jacket gapes in shock, his mouth wide open.  "you..." "god... damn... ghost.....!" 
11.1.C.1.jpg; The muscular man with red hair smiles, teeth bared, at a nervous man in a red jacket.  "i can't understand you because you're a loser that can't even use aura."
11.1.D.0.jpg; The red-haired man smiles cruelly, eyes wide, as the gray-haired man cowers beside him. "is it painful?" "if you don't like it, just kill yourself."
11.1.D.1.jpg; The gray-haired man stares at the ground, his face a picture of distress. "oh right! if you did, the kill counter would increase again!"
11.1.E.0.jpg; The green humanoid, enraged and powerful, attacks with a furious expression. "11" 
11.1.E.1.jpg;  The green humanoid continues his enraged attack as a terrified man in a red jacket cringes nearby.  "slow!"
11.2.A.1.jpg; A man in brown shoes and dark pants runs forward. "even though i can see the attack, why won't my body respond properly?"
11.2.B.0.jpg; The red-haired man and the man in the red jacket fight aggressively. "ugh...!" 
11.2.B.1.jpg; The long-haired man is shoved forward by the man in the red jacket.  "you can dodge it. don't give up."
11.2.C.0.jpg; A man in a red shirt lies exhausted in the forest. "orcs are low-level mobs with simple attack patterns." "it's easy once you figure out their attacks! now, gather aura in your legs!"
11.2.C.1.jpg; The man in the red jacket runs determinedly through the forest. "easier said than done..." 
11.2.D.0.jpg; A foot wearing a black shoe with rainbow lights takes a step forward. "i can dodge it if i move just a single step."
11.2.D.1.jpg; The brown-haired man yells desperately. "legs, please move.....!"
11.2.E.jpg; A heart pulsates, emanating bright white light.
11.2.F.0.jpg;  A man walks forward, electricity crackling around his leg as an orc swings at him. 
11.2.F.1.jpg; The black-haired man in a red shirt stands triumphantly, having dodged an attack. "i dodged it!"  "harder than expected, right?" 
11.3.A.0.jpg;  The red-haired man points at a glowing red heart. "that's because you don't have any proper tunnels for the aura to flow through your body." "if i were to come up with an analogy, your body is like a small path deep in the mountains?"
11.3.A.1.jpg; The red-haired man sits cross-legged, floating in mid-air on a pipe, watching the brown-haired man race below. "You need to reconstruct that into a highway in order to use aura properly." 
11.3.B.0.jpg; The man in the red jacket sprints through the forest. "you can feel the aura now thanks to the potion. normally, you would feel jack shit!"
11.3.B.1.jpg; A green creature's arm blurs as it swings with intense power. 
11.3.C.0.jpg; The green creature grins, swinging its fist as red and blue energy crackles around it.  "tch, that girl may have poor sanitation standards, but her skills are first-rate!" 
11.3.C.1.jpg; The green creature roars, red streaks marking its body, as the man in the red jacket falls from the sky. "guooohhhhahh"
11.3.D.jpg; The man with short brown hair plummets, helpless and distressed. 
11.4.A.jpg; The red-haired man, face set in a determined expression, speaks. "once i... turn this small path... into a highway..." "happen?"
11.4.B.0.jpg; Red sparks crackle around the brown-haired man's clenched fist, his face a mask of anger and frustration. "it frustrates me, but the guardian spirit is right."
11.4.B.1.jpg;  The man in the red jacket concentrates, red sparks erupting from his trembling fist.  "flow... aura..." 
11.4.C.0.jpg; The green creature sails helplessly through the air. "an abandoned path covered in weeds."
11.4.C.1.jpg; The man in the red jacket tumbles uncontrollably through a blue tunnel.  "damn it!" "it's a fitting metaphor for the current me." 
11.4.D.jpg;  Uncertainty hangs in the air. "what... might... happen..."
11.4.E.jpg; The red-haired man smirks, arrogance in his gaze. "heh."
11.4.F.jpg;  A blood-splattered sky sets the scene. "you had your head cut off by old man marcus without being able to do a thing, right?" "that's right."
11.4.G.0.jpg;  An upside-down man with white hair, clad in a blue suit, clutches a glowing sword as red flowers swirl around him. 
11.4.G.1.jpg; A large moon hangs in the blue sky as pink flowers drift down. "that was the skill of someone only at the level of a neighborhood street."
11.4.H.jpg; The dark-haired man glares, his expression a mix of anger and disgust. "even that beautiful strike?" "gramps still has a long way to go."  "as for you, do i even need to say it, you zombie?"
11.4.I.jpg; The brown-haired man, clad in red and gray, lets out a sound, shock and anger on his face. 
11.5.A.0.jpg; A green monster with glowing red eyes swings a massive club. 
11.5.A.1.jpg;  The brown-haired man, still in his red and grey attire, flees from the monstrous creature. 
11.5.B.0.jpg; Bathed in white light, the brown-haired man yells in anger and frustration, trees blurring behind him. 
11.5.B.1.jpg; Sword drawn, the man in the red jacket faces down a large, angry creature. "if the other hunters get to it first, our profits would dwindle."
11.5.C.jpg; A red-haired man with a smirk peers out from the edge of the panel.  "would you look at that?"
11.5.D.0.jpg; Anger and determination etched on his face, the man in the red shirt races through the forest. 
11.5.D.1.jpg;  The man in the red jacket kneels, white and red energy crackling around him. "that's pretty creative."

11.6.A.jpg; Through the eye of a slain creature, the man in the red jacket glares, clutching his green sword. 
11.6.B.0.jpg; A glowing blue sword pierces the roaring green creature, a look of pain and fear twisting its features. 
11.6.B.1.jpg; He swiftly attacks with his green sword, a surge of red light emanating from his strike.
11.6.C.0.jpg; With a determined look, the red-haired man in a white shirt moves quickly, a blur of motion. "Don't let your guard down till the end." 
11.6.C.1.jpg; He attacks the colossal green creature with his sword, leaving it writhing in pain. "Orcs have a thick skin!"
11.6.D.0.jpg;  His hand glows intensely as he swings his sword, aiming at an unseen target. "Focus your aura on the edge of your blade!" "Well, that might be too hard for you."
11.6.D.1.jpg;  With fierce determination, he attacks the large, red-eyed creature.  "Just pour all your aura into the tip of your sword!"
11.6.E.0.jpg; He cries out in pain, his face contorted in agony, as he struggles against a powerful force. "Fuck.." "ing.."
11.6.E.1.jpg; Enraged, he roars with fury, ready to unleash his wrath. "Die.. !!!"
11.6.F.0.jpg; A giant red Korean character, outlined in green, dominates the scene as a massive explosion of green and white light erupts beneath it.
11.6.F.1.jpg;  He attacks the monstrous green creature, his sword a beacon amidst the blinding green explosion.
11.7.A.0.jpg;  Surrounded by streaks of green light, he stands with an unflinching gaze, emanating an aura of immense power. 
11.7.A.1.jpg; Fear flashes in his eyes as he struggles to push back the hulking green creature with his glowing blade, bright green energy erupting from the point of contact.
11.7.B.jpg; He lies on his stomach, surrounded by lush greenery, pain etched across his back. "Does it hurt?"
11.7.C.0.jpg; He desperately stabs at the roaring monster's chest with his weapon, a surge of green energy erupting from it, while the red-haired person watches. "It hurts, right?" 
11.7.C.1.jpg; The red-haired person, their face obscured, glares disapprovingly.  "I bet it really fucking hurts." "You haven't even cleared a proper tunnel, yet you used your aura willy nilly."
11.7.D.0.jpg;  Head bowed in defeat, the black-haired man is the picture of despair and agony. "I bet it feels like you're dying, with how weak your body is." "You ruined your whole body simply trying to catch a single measly orc."
11.7.D.1.jpg; Tears stream down his face as he cries out in anguish and frustration.  "You..." "Asshole..."
11.7.E.0.jpg;  Words of encouragement fill the air.  "But what you did at the end, compressing your aura like a spring, that was good!" "I'll compliment you for that. A hunter must always use their head while fighting."
11.7.E.1.jpg;  The muscular red-haired man, a confident smirk on his face, gestures towards someone unseen.
11.8.A.0.jpg;  Astonishment hangs in the air.  "Something like..." "That, doesn't..."
11.8.A.1.jpg; He clutches his chest, his face contorted in pain as he lies helpless. "Make me, blargh..." 
11.8.B.jpg; Covered in blood, he lays in the darkness, his face contorted in agony, a white cloth clutched to his chest.  "Do you really feel like you're gonna die?"
11.8.C.jpg; Tears stream down his face, his expression etched with anguish. "Are... you..." "Blind..."
11.8.D.jpg;  He stares resolutely ahead, a small cut marring his face, but his spirit unbroken. "So you'll feel fine if you die."
11.8.E.jpg; Words of explanation hang in the air. "If it weren't for your returner skill, I wouldn't suggest this kind of training method." "Old man Marcus also just meditates after taking this potion." "He doesn't use his body recklessly like you."
11.8.F.jpg;  Standing over the green figure, he stares down in disgust. "This fucking ghost?"
11.8.G.jpg; He grins, a wide, carefree smile, the white bandage around his chest a stark contrast to his jovial expression.  "But you simply return if you die! How sweet is that?" "No matter how rough the training is, your body will remain normal. Damn! I'm jealous."
11.8.H.0.jpg; A curious proposal hangs in the air.  "Hey, zombie." "Since your kill counter goes up when you commit suicide."
11.8.H.1.jpg;  He stares in bewilderment, perched atop the massive green figure, its eyes wide and mouth agape. 
11.8.I.0.jpg; A strategic shift is announced. "Let's use a method that doesn't increase your kill counter." The gaping maw of the green figure looms in the foreground.
11.8.I.1.jpg;  He sits atop the green figure, his expression serious, a towering, muscular figure looming behind him. 
11.9.A.0.jpg;  The red-haired man frowns, a hint of concern in his eyes. "You know, you got the hang of using aura on your first try."  "At this rate, I think dying about 100 times should be enough?"
11.9.A.1.jpg;   He pumps his fist, a wide grin spreading across his face.  "A journey starts with one step, and a hundred deaths starts with one death!"
11.9.B.0.jpg; The monstrous green figure, eyes blazing red and mouth agape, attacks with ferocious intensity. 
11.9.B.1.jpg;  His eyes widen in alarm, a gasp escaping his lips as he catches sight of something off-screen. 
11.9.C.jpg;  Standing in the stark black and white room, he steels himself for what's to come.  "First death, let's go!" 
11.9.D.jpg;  The blue rectangle, stark against the black void, bears the stark message: "[You have died.]" 
11.9.E.jpg; He crumples to his knees, burying his head in his hands, despair washing over him.  "Damn it, fuck......." "My head hurts......."
11.9.F.jpg;   He stares in astonishment, eyes wide, as the red-haired man beside him gasps in surprise. "Wow! What's this?!"
11.9.G.jpg;  He looks down, dejected, lost in thought as he absorbs his surroundings. "This is the place where I remain for a bit after dying." "I'm temporarily calling this place the nether world."
11.9.H.0.jpg;  He can't help but be intrigued. "Damn, this is super cool..."  "After a bit, you'll hear it go, 'You will return 24 hours back to the past!'" 
11.9.H.1.jpg;  Eyes wide with shock, he points. "Killed by the Flame Emperor and Sword Saint..."
11.10.A.jpg;  He stares, stunned, at the message hovering before him. "[The condition for your skill has been fulfilled by your death.]"  "A skill..."
11.10.B.0.jpg; A brown card, adorned with a black design, materializes.  "Was also... copied..." "[Randomly copying monster orc's skills.]"
11.10.B.1.jpg;  The red-haired woman turns towards the card, her gaze fixed on it in wonder, while the dark-haired man peers over her shoulder, his face a mask of astonishment. 
11.10.C.jpg; He stares in awe at the towering, muscular man beside him, his own small stature dwarfed by the newcomer's imposing presence.  
11.10.D.0.jpg; Both stare in disbelief, the red-haired giant gesturing emphatically.  "Monsters also have skills?!?!"
11.10.D.1.jpg;  The red-haired man throws his hands up in the air, his face a mixture of shock and excitement.  "What the fuck!!!!! This really is a super cheat-like skill!!!!!!!!!!"
11.10.E.jpg; A blue box, edged with glowing blue lines, displays the message: "[Please select a skill card.]"
11.10.F.jpg; The words hang in the air, vibrant with longing and desire.  "I want this skill too-!!!!!!!!"
12.1.A.0.jpg;  He stares at the blue box, his brow furrowed in frustration.  "Who the fuck is supervising this tower?!?!" 
12.1.A.1.jpg; A man in a red shirt stares angrily at a square brown object. "why in the world did you give this godly skill to a loser like this and not a great hunter like me?" 
12.1.B.jpg;  "this is going to shatter the hunter meta!!" the green-haired man in the red shirt exclaims nervously. Behind him, a red-haired man clutches his head in worry. 
12.1.C.0.jpg; The green-haired man stares with shock at the square brown object in his hand. "a skill of a monster..." he whispers.
12.1.C.1.jpg;  "i'll just pick whatever..." he says with sudden determination, glancing upwards. 
12.1.D.jpg; "huh? wait. you're going to pick that one?" the red-haired man asks in disbelief. "what about it?" the green-haired man retorts confidently. "it's not like it matters what i pick." 
12.1.E.0.jpg;  He hesitates, staring at the brown object. *shouldn't you pick the best option while you have the chance?* he thinks anxiously.  *but i don't have a way of telling which card is better. they're both shit-colored. this is just a game of luck.*
12.1.E.1.jpg; The red-haired man glares at the green-haired man, who returns a confused look. 
12.1.F.0.jpg; "what do you mean, you don't know which skill is better?" the red-haired man shouts furiously. "seriously, do you not get what i'm saying?"
12.1.F.1.jpg; The green-haired man glowers, an angry expression on his face.
12.1.G.jpg;  "the colors of the cards are the same! and i can only see the back sides!" he thinks with frustration. "how am i supposed to know which skill is better?" 
12.1.H.0.jpg; Two blurry cards, edges glowing, float in the air. "i can see them, though?"
12.1.H.1.jpg;  The red-haired man in a white karate gi gapes in shock and anger. 
12.2.A.0.jpg; "what?" The brown-haired man in a red jacket clutches his head in confusion, staring at a screen that reads "[please select]".  "i can see them." he murmurs. "the front sides."
12.2.A.1.jpg;  Eyes widening in shock, the man in the red jacket looks down at the stern, red-haired man in a white karate gi, arms crossed.  Above them, a blue screen reads "a skill card". "the location...!!"
12.2.B.0.jpg;  "The skill cards always move in a way that the backside is always facing me!"  A brown card hangs in the air. "it's the same even if i tilt my head upwards." 
12.2.B.1.jpg; "so... you're able to read the contents of these cards?" the brown-haired man questions, pointing with a bewildered expression.
12.2.C.jpg;  "but the guardian spirit can fly around freely!" the text declares.  "that's why he can see the other side of the cards!" 
12.2.D.0.jpg; The red-haired man lies on his stomach, an exasperated expression on his face. 
12.2.D.1.jpg; Propping himself up on his elbows, the red-haired man in the karate gi looks up at the other man. "of course i can see them. do you not trust my eyes?" he asks, gesturing at the brown card between them. 
12.2.E.0.jpg;  "i was well-known for having good eyesight ever since i was a kid, you know? when i grew older, i even obtained true sight..."   "eureka!!" 
12.2.E.1.jpg;  "no way!"  The dark-haired man in the red jacket pumps his fist excitedly, a triumphant grin on his face.
12.2.F.0.jpg;  "are you crazy?!? why did you suddenly shout?!?" the blue-shirted man cries, recoiling from the pink-haired man who snarls in fury. 
12.2.F.1.jpg;  "whatever." the dark-haired man in the red jacket says with a shrug and a grin.  He gazes upwards at a white-clad figure flying upside down. "just tell me what skills they are!!"
12.2.G.jpg; "...alright." the pink-haired man concedes, stroking his chin thoughtfully. "i'll only read it once, so listen closely." 
12.3.A.0.jpg;  "-card i-"   A volcano erupts against a fiery sky.  "oh, nature gives us a place to call home, but it also gives us hardships! in this harsh world, the orc race raised its reproductivity and didn't lose to nature."
12.3.A.1.jpg;  Two green orcs kiss passionately, a red rose clutched between their teeth. "one orc died?"  "don't worry! in a place you can't see, there are still 9 more!" More orcs embrace amidst a field of flowers.  "blessing of reproduction rank f"
12.3.B.0.jpg; "-card 2-" An orc in a white t-shirt, sunglasses perched on his nose, leans back casually. "we always add tchweek at the end of our sentence tchweek.  we don't know why we do this either, tchwik!" 
12.3.B.1.jpg;  Two orcs in sunglasses stand side-by-side, their faces grim. "but you should also take a sip of the tchweek, tchwik."  "then you'll never be able to escape the fun of the tchweek tchweek for eternity tchwik."  "tchweek tchwik rank f"
12.3.C.jpg; The dark-haired man in the red jacket stares in open-mouthed shock.
12.3.D.0.jpg; The pink-haired man sits with his legs crossed, eyes closed in thought. "do you see now? if i didn't stop you, you would have selected itchweek, tchwik. now, gong-ja, don't you think that since you were born a man, it's worth it obtaining the strength of an orc?" 
12.3.D.1.jpg; "hey, i think you have your speech and thoughts mixed up..."  The dark-haired man in the red shirt glances back at a white-robed man hovering in the air.  "you're just spouting garbage." "they're both garbage." the floating man retorts. "but if i were to pick, it'd be itchweek, tchwiki..." 
12.3.E.jpg; "anyways, i think i'm right." the green-haired man says with a confident smirk. "[tchweek, tchwiki] is better than [blessing of reproduction]."
12.4.A.0.jpg; "no, no, no. gong-ja, wait!!"  The text hangs in the air, urgent and bright.  "stop! please give it a bit more thought...!" 
12.4.A.1.jpg; A muscular, red-haired man in a white robe lunges towards the green-haired man, who looks up in alarm. 
12.4.B.0.jpg;  The green-haired man throws back his head and laughs, glancing at the shocked, muscular man beside him.
12.4.B.1.jpg;  "it seems like you are having the same thought as me." the red-haired man chuckles. "what are you...?" 
12.4.C.0.jpg;  "ah." the red-haired man gasps, hands thrown in the air as a blue square materializes. [selection complete. copying skill. ]  A man in a red shirt sprints towards it. 
12.4.C.1.jpg; "noooooooooo!!!!!!" the man in the red shirt cries, flinging his arms above his head. "yes!!!!!!!!"
12.4.D.0.jpg;  [you are currently an f-rank hunter.]  The message glows coldly. 
12.4.D.1.jpg; The green-haired man sits on the edge of a bed, a confused frown on his face. 
12.4.E.jpg; "alright!" The blue digital interface confirms: "there is no penalty for the skill usage."
12.5.A.0.jpg; "ah sweet. sang-ryun really is the best. staying at a nice place really does make my mind and body feel refreshed!" the text reads.
12.5.A.1.jpg;  "damn it!! i thought he would fall for it!!!" the dark-haired young man laughs, watching as the muscular, red-haired man rushes past.
12.5.B.0.jpg; "who would pick [blessing of reproduction] there?"  The red-haired man in the white karate outfit fumes, clutching his head. "stop throwing a tantrum, and let's go hunting."
12.5.B.1.jpg;   The dark-haired young man strides confidently, a cup of coffee in his hand. [hunter status window open.]
12.5.C.jpg;  The yellow digital interface displays the information clearly: "name: kim gong-ja rank: f skills 4/4 1. i want to become just like you s+: passive 2. returner's winding clock ex: passive 3. sword throne a+: passive 4. tchweek, tchwik f: active"  "alright, i don't see any problems."
12.5.D.0.jpg; "so, gong-ja, i thought about it hard..."  "what?"  "and i think you should just train by sitting still in a lotus position. it hurts to die!"
12.5.D.1.jpg; The red-haired man in the white karate uniform stands before the young man in the blue jacket, an eager look in his eyes.
12.5.E.0.jpg;  "let's just take it easy and train lotus-style. yeah?" the red-haired man suggests, pointing at the younger man. "i'll let you achieve aura in just half a year! to the floor 3 hunting grounds!"
12.5.E.1.jpg; [moving to the floor 3 hunting grounds.]  "can you not hear me?????!!" the red-haired man roars, his face a mask of fury. 
12.5.F.jpg;  The man in the blue jacket takes a long drink from his water bottle. "mmm! delicious." 
12.5.G.0.jpg;  In a sun-dappled forest, the man in the blue jacket shields his face with his hand while the man in the white robe smiles mischievously.  "hey, mister sword emperor, did you know?" 
12.5.G.1.jpg;  The large green creature raises an eyebrow in surprise as the man in the blue jacket speaks. "huh? what? you want to get into the lotus position?"
12.6.A.0.jpg;  The clouds drift lazily across a bright blue sky. "you call me 'zombie' when you're at an advantage and 'gong-ja' when you're not."
12.6.A.1.jpg;  The man in the blue jacket smiles confidently, wielding two swords with practiced ease. 
12.6.B.0.jpg;  The wind whispers through the trees. "and earlier, you called me gong-ja." The annoyance is clear.  "i'm kindly letting you know so you can fix that habit."
12.6.B.1.jpg;  With a swift parry, the man in the blue jacket deflects the axe blow from the large green creature. 
12.6.C.jpg;  The green creature stares in disbelief, its jaw agape.  "guruk?"
12.6.D.0.jpg;  The green creature roars in fury, its muscles coiled tight with rage.
12.6.D.1.jpg;  The green creature lunges forward, its yellow eyes blazing with anger. 
12.6.E.jpg;   He stares in disbelief at the creature before him. "as expected, his movements look slow again!"
12.6.F.0.jpg;   A green hand shoots out, grabbing for a fallen branch as the man in the blue hoodie raises his red sword. "Gooohhh!"
12.6.F.1.jpg;  The green monster reels, caught off guard by the sudden attack. 
12.6.G.0.jpg;  "[activating skills.]" He narrows his eyes, a sudden thought striking him. "tchweek?" 
12.6.G.1.jpg;  The large green monster, axe held high, stands opposite the man in the blue hoodie, their weapons crackling with energy.
12.6.H.jpg;  The green monster jerks its head up, startled by the sudden movement.  "tchweek!" The man in the blue hoodie stares in shock. "tchweek?"

12.6.I.1.jpg; The man in the blue hoodie attacks with lightning speed, his sword a blur as he catches the surprised monster off guard. 
12.7.A.jpg;   "tchwee..." The large green monster staggers back, green liquid oozing from the wound on its neck.

12.7.C.jpg;  The man in the blue jacket stands over his defeated opponent, a triumphant grin on his face.  "you fucking cheater!!! i knew this would happen!!"
12.7.D.jpg;   He stares at the green sword in his hand, a wave of guilt washing over him. "are you happy with tricking an innocent orc like that?! are ya?!" The voice echoes through the trees. "can you not even take a moment to consider how the orc might feel?"
12.7.E.jpg;  Anger flares, hot and bright. "the innocent orcs of this world are getting hurt because of dirty humans like you!"
12.7.F.jpg;  "tchweek!" The man in the blue jacket smirks, his arrogance evident in the way he shoves his hand in his pocket. 
12.7.G.0.jpg;  "ahhh! fuck! i'm so angry!" The red-haired man crashes through the trees, his face contorted in frustration. 
12.7.G.1.jpg;  He shoves the man in the blue jacket, sending him stumbling back. "o' tower, why did you give a cheat-like skill to a little shit like this?!" A calm voice responds, "don't sweat it, and just follow me already."
13.1.A.jpg; The large orc, a crown perched atop his head, smiles gently. "goruk." 
13.1.B.0.jpg;  The Goblin King, a fearsome figure in his black cape and crown of bone, sits upon his throne.  "floor 5 boss monster goblin king"
13.1.B.1.jpg;  The large orc, clad in a simple orange shirt, regards the man in the black suit with quiet intensity. 
13.1.C.0.jpg;  He stands in the dimly lit building, his brow furrowed in concern.

13.1.D.jpg;   A yellow rectangle shimmers into existence, edged with glowing orange light. "[skill name:"
13.1.E.0.jpg;   "goruk!!!!!!!" The man in the grey jacket unleashes his attack, a surge of red and white energy erupting around him. 
13.1.E.1.jpg;  A single red line streaks upwards against a teal and white background. "[goblin high society] rank: f"
13.1.F.0.jpg;   "how can some- one other than i..."  The man in the brown jacket launches himself at the startled goblin. "goruk?!" 
13.1.F.1.jpg;  "speak such a perfect language of the king-!!!"  He stands over the defeated goblin.  "you were the strongest enemy i'd faced all week."
13.1.G.jpg;   He lies on the ground, his face a mask of pain, but a flicker of defiance remains in his eyes.  "farewell, my honorable opponent..."  He chokes out a response, "bull fucking shit."
13.2.A.0.jpg;   "why are you getting so emotional over defeating a single monster?" The red-haired man stares, jaw agape, as the man in the black shirt walks away, his expression unreadable. 
13.2.A.1.jpg;  The red-haired man stands frozen, his disbelief evident in his shocked expression.  "god damn!!!"
13.2.B.0.jpg;  He gestures towards the pixelated image. "i just barely got him after 6 coins."  He rounds on the red-haired man, "am i not allowed to get a little emotional?!? " 
13.2.B.1.jpg;   He slams the knife down on the table, his eyes narrowed in fury. "1 coin = 1 life"
13.2.C.0.jpg;  "i'm only stating facts!!" The red-haired man throws his hands up in exasperation.  "besides, could you even call that an honorable fight?!"
13.2.C.1.jpg;  The man in the white shirt glares at the man in the black jacket, who stares back in fear, clutching his chest.
13.2.D.0.jpg;  He gestures towards the yellow panel.  "Look at this. I fought him fair and square with the skill that cost me 5 coins' worth of life..." "[goblin high society] rank: f Effect: The goblin king was lost in thought. 'Our goblin culture is too unsophisticated. All our words end in keruruk. How can I show off my royal authority like this!?' That's when the ingenuity of the goblin king came in. That's right! From now" 
13.2.D.1.jpg;  "On, the noble I will speak goruk instead of keruk. Goruk! What a dictation fit for my noble essence." He shakes his head, a smirk playing on his lips. "however, the struggle between tribes will worsen.  skill copied from the goblin king" He chuckles softly. "it's kind of amazing that even goblins worry about such worthless things...keruk or goruk, doesn't make a difference" 
13.2.E.jpg;  The red-haired man scoffs, his arms crossed tightly over his chest. "that's why they are goblins. humans are not different."
13.2.F.jpg;  "excuse me?" The man in the black jacket recoils, his eyes wide with surprise. 
13.2.G.jpg; The red-haired man clenches his jaw, his frustration evident in the set of his shoulders. 
13.2.H.0.jpg;  "What do you mean by-" He pauses, his curiosity piqued as a blue panel materializes before him.  "[your existence becomes better defined. ]"
13.2.H.1.jpg;  His face pales, his eyes widening in alarm. "reaperscans.com" 
13.3.A.jpg;  Two men, one with short black hair and the other with long red hair, stood in a glass building, their faces etched with concern. "If the other hunters get to it first, our profits would dwindle."
13.3.B.0.jpg;  Excitement crackled in the air as a bright blue screen in the glass building flashed, "Hunter Kim Gong-ja is leveling up."
13.3.B.1.jpg;  The man with short black hair stood in a red room, red particles cascading around him, his arms raised defensively as if summoning a powerful force. "reaperscans.com" could be seen in the corner. 
13.3.C.0.jpg;  Suddenly, a light blue box materialized above the man's head, "your skill slots have expanded." it declared, bathing his surprised and delighted face in a blue glow. "Finally." he breathed, red particles swirling around him. 
13.3.C.1.jpg;  A wide smile lit up the man's face as a new message appeared above him, "you are now an e-rank hunter!"  He stretched out his hands confidently, red particles dancing around him in the white room. 
13.3.D.0.jpg; The glass-walled room blurred as red lines of light and particles swirled within, creating an atmosphere of mystery. "Finally...." echoed a voice.
13.3.D.1.jpg;  In a pink room filled with gently falling white particles, the man stood with his eyes closed, a peaceful smile gracing his face. "[May fortune be with you.]"
13.3.E.0.jpg;  The two men stood in a room with a grey floor, confusion clouding their expressions.  "...was it sparks?" one voice wondered. "Or maybe drops of blood?" another chimed in. "Tsk, that was fusing." a third voice declared.
13.3.E.1.jpg;  The man with black hair looked down at his companion, who sported a new bandage on his arm, a smirk playing on his lips. "Just now, that was the level-up effect, right?" he asked. "Yeah, it doesn't happen just for you to look cool." 
13.3.F.jpg;  The man in the dark grey coat stared down in confusion, a single word floating above his head:  "A hint?" 
13.4.A.0.jpg;  A person with brown hair stood amidst a city skyline, silhouetted against the orange glow of burning buildings, sparks flying from a glowing object in their hand. "The shape of aura you'll possess is foretold by what effects show up when you level up."
13.4.A.1.jpg;  The man with long black hair examined the glowing object in his hand, sparks flying around him. Around him, the city blazed. "For example, the flame emperor you killed." he said, "I bet his was [fire]."
13.4.B.jpg;  In a dimly lit corridor, the man with long brown hair smiled at the glowing object in his hand, sparks reflecting off the walls. "Sparks, you say..."
13.4.C.0.jpg;  Outside, massive structures loomed against the backdrop of a blue, cloud-dappled sky. "The shape of one's aura usually takes after the hunter's trauma."
13.4.C.1.jpg;  The red-haired man, his face etched with contemplation, stroked his chin. "Well, it's not always a bad memory..." he mused.  "It's based off of a life-defining moment or event that gets reflected in the shape of your aura. I guess it's like a form of subconsciousness?"
13.4.D.jpg;  Tension filled the large room as the red-haired man locked eyes with the black-haired man. "Based on my judgment, Zombie, you are either fire or blood."  "Then...what is the Sword Saint's aura shape?"
13.4.E.0.jpg;  The crescent moon hung high in the night sky, casting a serene glow over the sleeping forest below. "Moonlight." a voice whispered.
13.4.E.1.jpg;  In a moonlit field, a lone figure in a black suit stood with their back turned, a solitary figure against the backdrop of the night.
13.4.F.jpg;  The person with white hair, their face creased with contemplation, stared sadly into the distance. "When the old man was a kid, he got lost in the mountains." they began, "he didn't want to die, so he crawled up to the mountain top..."
13.4.G.jpg;  The person in the dark suit gasped, their gaze fixed upwards in wonder. "He says that the moon in the clear sky was absolutely astonishing." 
13.4.H.0.jpg;  The words hung in the air, imbued with a sense of peace and optimism. "The moon shines not with its own strength but by receiving light from the sun, yet a life where you only receive is still beautiful."
13.4.I.jpg;  The red-haired man stood with his back turned, oblivious to the shock on his companion's face. "12 years old." he breathed, staring at the bursts of light. "The Sword Saint definitely ain't normal."
13.5.A.jpg;   "Anyways!" the red-haired man declared, snapping his fingers with a confident grin. "We cleared floor 5. Let's go to floor 6."
13.5.B.jpg;   The man in the grey jacket smiled confidently. "Oh, about that." he began, "can't we just go and raid the floor 10 boss?"
13.5.C.0.jpg;   Disbelief filled the air. "What?" "Hey, aren't you being over-confident despite being a newbie?"
13.5.C.1.jpg;  "I promise you, that's not it." The man in the grey jacket held his ground, a confident smirk on his face as the red-haired man glared at him accusingly. 
13.5.D.jpg;  "Do you know how many years several great hunters have wasted on floor 10?" the red-haired man roared, his face a mask of fury.
13.5.E.jpg;  The man in the grey jacket held up two fingers, his confidence unwavering. "If I can't clear floor 10 in 2 coins, I promise to start calling you master. Huh? You're saying you can defeat it after just one death?"
13.5.F.0.jpg;  Arrogance dripped from every word.  "It took you 6 coins to defeat the Goblin King, yet you think you can clear floor 10 in 2 coins? You don't seem to know your place, but I don't take it easy with bets... however! I have a condition."
13.5.F.1.jpg;  The red-haired man pointed at his companion, a smug smirk playing on his lips, his arrogance almost tangible.  
13.5.G.0.jpg;  The man with brown hair pointed a finger directly at his companion, a sharp glint in his eye. "You have to be honest and tell me what skills the floor 10 boss has." he demanded. 
13.5.G.1.jpg;  The red-haired man crossed his arms, a thoughtful expression on his face. "Hmm, well, that seems fair..." he conceded. "Also!"
13.5.H.0.jpg;  The man with brown hair smirked, his gaze fixed on something beyond his companion.  "If I win, you have to call me Gong-ja-nim,* as politely as you can." he declared. "Tn: nim is an honorific added to refer to someone very respectfully."
13.5.H.1.jpg;  A taunting smirk spread across the red-haired man's face.  "Why, you want to chicken out? You can call it quits if you want." he challenged.
13.6.A.0.jpg;  The red-haired man's face crumpled in distress, his gaze fixed on something off-screen. 
13.6.A.1.jpg;  Suddenly, rage consumed the red-haired man's features.  "You goddamn motherfucking little piece of shit." he roared, "you think you can pick a fight with the great Sword Emperor just because you have a cheat-like skill?"
13.6.B.0.jpg;  "Bet!" he yelled.  "Kim Zombie, be prepared to serve me as your master your whole life, because you won't be able to clear the floor 10 boss. Right! Since you can't die, you'll have to call me master for all eternity!"
13.6.B.1.jpg;  The man in the black turtleneck, arms crossed confidently, met the red-haired man's pointing finger with an unflinching stare. "Do you have the delusion skill?" the red-haired man spat. "Just be ready to serve me as if I'm Confucius*."
13.6.C.jpg;  A menacing grin spread across the red-haired man's face as he locked eyes with his opponent, a dark chuckle escaping his lips.  "Ehehe hehehe."  The man in black returned the grin, his own laugh echoing ominously. "Muaha hahahaha."  "Tn: it's a play of words as Gong-ja-nim is how Koreans commonly refer to Confucius."
13.6.D.jpg;  The man in the black jacket stood confidently in the archway, a triumphant smirk playing on his lips as he glanced sideways. "Heheheheehe." Beside him, a woman and a man in a green hat watched in bewilderment. 
13.6.E.jpg;   "I think he went crazy..." a concerned voice whispered.
13.6.F.0.jpg;  A silver emblem gleamed on the wall, its crowned figure seeming to pronounce a silent decree:  "You may not."
13.6.F.1.jpg;  Before a massive wooden gate, a knight stood guard, his expression severe, his spear held at the ready. "Not." he echoed the emblem's message.
13.6.G.jpg;   The man in the green hoodie stared at his red-haired companion, who sat lost in thought on the bridge railing. "Why is that?" he asked, his brow furrowed in confusion.
13.6.H.jpg;  The knight's face contorted in apprehension as he reread the messages above.  "You want to challenge the boss by yourself? Going on a solo hunt is an act of suicide." 
13.6.I.jpg;  "Didn't you watch the news?" the man in the green hoodie gestured emphatically, exasperation lacing his voice.  "The Black Dragon Guild went on a raid with 34 of its elite members and still failed." He threw his hands up in the air.  "So what? It's the association rule to allow any hunters that want to raid in."
13.6.J.0.jpg;  The knight stood rigidly, his fists clenched, a red aura radiating from his chest towards the man in the green hoodie. The man watched with a curious frown.
13.6.J.1.jpg;  "I'm sorry, but I have to keep a record of all hunters that enter here." the knight stated formally. "My superiors will be looking over those records later."
13.7.A.0.jpg;   "I'll be the heartless bastard that let someone head to their death!" the frustrated voice boomed. "Think about the position I'm in as well!" "What? Hunter Association? My world didn't have something like that!"
13.7.A.1.jpg;  The man in the green hoodie watched helplessly as his red-haired companion stormed away.  "What should I do...?" he wondered aloud, his face etched with worry. 
13.7.B.0.jpg;  The man with short brown hair glares down, frustrated. "Playing these lame games of politics is the reason why you guys are still stuck on floor 10! Kim Zombie! Just beat this guy up and go in. Mr. Guard."
13.7.B.1.jpg; The man in the green hoodie faces the armored man, who smiles slightly at him. "I ap-preciate your hard work. And what you're saying is right." 
13.7.C.0.jpg;  He flashes a wide smile.  "To be honest, I..."
13.7.C.1.jpg;  The man in the green hoodie stares down at his feet in the pink room, despair heavy in his posture. "Really do want to commit suicide..."
13.7.D.jpg; The redhead stares at the silver-helmeted man with a serious expression. "Pardon?" the confused man in the silver helmet responds. 
13.7.E.jpg;  Memories flood his mind, bringing a wave of sorrow. "A year ago... my significant other died. And a little while ago, the alchemy castle told me I have an incurable illness... They say I have half a year at most, but I can't live on with my lover gone..."
13.7.F.jpg;  He smiles, placing a hand on his chest. "But here's the thing. I might be of the lowest tier, but I'm still a hunter. Instead of waiting for my life to end in the alchemy castle's hospital ward, I'd like to challenge some monsters till the end." 
13.7.G.jpg; The armored man gazes sadly upward, his grip tight on his spear.  "Such a tragic story..."
13.7.H.0.jpg; With a serious expression, the man in the green hoodie holds out a red bag to the silver-armored man. "Here. This is the money I saved up for my treatment." 
13.7.H.1.jpg;  He looks down at the offering, a serious expression on his face. "I-I can't accept this money... !" 
13.7.I.0.jpg; The man's face is etched with worry. "Since I'll disappear anyway, I want to go without leaving anything behind."
13.7.I.1.jpg;  He keeps his back to the viewer, his request barely a whisper. "Mr. Guard, please don't leave any records of my entry either."
13.7.J.0.jpg; The worry in the guard's eyes deepens.  "This is my last request as a hunter."
13.7.J.1.jpg; He grips his spear, a hesitant look on his face. "I understand. Please go on ahead. I didn't see anything..."
13.7.K.jpg; The redhead glares at the two men. "You're both fucking dumb. Are you two filming a movie?"
13.8.A.0.jpg;  The guard stands alone beneath the archway, his gaze fixed on the ground. 
13.8.A.1.jpg; The red-haired woman stares down at the man in the green hoodie. "Does it matter how, as long as I reach floor 10?" he asks from below. 
13.8.B.0.jpg; The cloudy sky looms over the treetops, the words "floor 10" hanging heavy in the air.
13.8.B.1.jpg; The two men stand before the imposing grey building, their gazes fixed on its upper floors. 
13.8.C.jpg;  The man in the green hoodie walks towards the red-haired man lounging on the wall. "A floor that should have been cleared by Yu Su-ha." he observes, his brow furrowed. 
13.8.D.0.jpg;  A woman with long pink hair peeks nervously out from a doorway, her brow creased with worry. 
13.8.D.1.jpg;  The man in the green hoodie cowers back as a man with long red hair lunges at him, his leg raised high.  
13.9.A.jpg; Two dolls with glowing red eyes stand ominously on the stairs, a legion of similarly eerie figures behind them. "Teehee." echoes from the stairwell.
13.9.B.jpg; The two dolls continue their chilling laughter, their red eyes gleaming in the dimly lit room. "Teeheeehee heeehee." their unsettling giggles fill the air. 
13.9.C.0.jpg; The man with red hair watches the inferno raging below with a delighted grin, while the frightened woman beside him shrinks back. "Will you play?" he asks excitedly. "What should we play?" The woman scrambles for ideas, fear tainting her words. "Freeze tag? What's the time, Mr. Wolf? All the ice melted! And the wolf is dead! Let's play hide-and-seek!"
13.9.C.1.jpg; The man in the green hoodie stands amidst the flames, a determined look on his face and his eyes glowing red. "The challenger is 1 person. Hunter Kim Gong-ja." announces a booming voice. "That's right! Play with us! Play hide-and-seek with us!" the eerie voices chime in from above. He squares his shoulders, a flicker of resolve in his eyes.  "Alright, I'll play."
14.1.A.jpg; The words "Black Dragon." stark white against the black background, announce the presence of the formidable guild: "Black Dragon, the guild that has secured its spot as the strongest guild since the opening of the tower."
14.1.B.jpg; The purple-haired woman shoves her way through the throng of reporters, her face a mask of fury. "Unfortunately, it has achieved its 30th failed raid today!" a voice announces above the chaotic din. 
14.1.C.0.jpg;  The unseen woman stands on the platform, the weight of the crowd's gazes heavy upon her. "What do you think was the reason you failed?" a voice inquires from the assembly.  
14.1.C.1.jpg;  The purple-haired woman strides confidently down the street, her head held high despite the flashing cameras and the clamor of the crowd. 
14.1.D.0.jpg; The woman with purple hair stands tall, her expression serious. "There is nothing wrong with our skills." 
14.1.D.1.jpg;  She raises her phone, a sly smile playing on her lips. "We just had a bit of bad luck."
14.1.E.0.jpg; The man with the sinister smile throws his head back and laughs. "Who said that?" 
14.1.E.1.jpg;  The man in the red jacket raises his phone, a triumphant smirk on his face. "[Floor 10 has been cleared.]  Luck is also a skill, losers."
14.1.F.jpg; He taps his temple, his smug expression unwavering.  "Here's the interview, later known as the loser assertion."
14.1.G.0.jpg; The group of young women, their red eyes burning, stand before a wall of flames. "Clear floor 10?" one voice asks. "The boss stage starting." another adds.  "Floor 10 boss monster Hellfire Maiden." a third chimes in. "Play with us?" they chorus, their voices dripping with menace. 
14.1.G.1.jpg; The man in the green jacket stands on the platform, flames licking at his heels. "Promise to make it fun?" he asks. 
14.2.A.0.jpg;  The remnants of the room blaze fiercely, the air thick with smoke. "Clearing floor 10 is relatively simple." reads a message amidst the wreckage. "You're it! Who's the real one?" another taunts from below. 
14.2.A.1.jpg; Flames engulf the room, casting an eerie orange glow on everything. "Hidden somewhere in this mansion..." a voice whispers through the crackling fire.
14.2.B.0.jpg; The boy with black hair grins mischievously, while the red-haired girl beside him flashes a wide, unsettling smile. "Find me! Find me!" they chant in unison, their voices echoing through the inferno. 
14.2.B.1.jpg;  The man in the green hoodie screams, fear twisting his features as he stares at the magical flames surrounding them. "You need to find the real doll and destroy it. These aren't just flames." the red-haired man beside him explains, his expression grave. 
14.2.C.0.jpg;  The man in the white coat coughs, struggling to breathe through the searing heat.  "It's hellfire created with [Aura]. No matter how much you protect yourself with your Aura, 10 minutes is the time limit one can handle these flames."
14.2.C.1.jpg; The man in the red jacket slams his fist down, a scoff escaping his lips as he surveys the scene. "But it would have no effect on a hunter that uses a [fire]-type Aura. Another dud." 
14.2.D.0.jpg; The man in the green jacket coughs violently, his gaze flickering over the group of young girls dancing amidst the flames. "Ready- or- not-" they sing, their voices eerily cheerful. "That's why... he was able to clear it safely..." he rasps. "Yet he has the audacity to claim that luck is also a skill..! Cough. Cough."
14.2.D.1.jpg; The red-haired man glares down at the figures struggling below, a cruel smile twisting his lips. "Come- and- find- us-." he taunts. "You're the zombie that survives off of luck."
14.2.E.0.jpg;  The man in the red shirt throws his hands up in exasperation, confusion evident on his face.  "What do you mean... I survive... off of luck...? Damn, it's hot!"
14.2.E.1.jpg;  The man in the green jacket stumbles back from the flames. "Look at this... I'm barely... hanging on with my Aura..!"
14.2.F.0.jpg; The red-haired man glances at his companion, concern furrowing his brow.  "Well, you'll hit your limit in a minute."
14.2.F.1.jpg; The man in the green jacket spins around to face his companion, his expression a mixture of anger and desperation. "Your limit?" he repeats. 
14.2.G.0.jpg;  The red-haired man throws his head back and laughs, a triumphant glint in his eyes. "Just so you know, old man Marcus can withstand these flames for 30 minutes! He's training like hell right now to lengthen his time limit to an hour before challenging. Unlike someone that just barged in recklessly!" 
14.2.G.1.jpg;  Clutching his wooden staff, a man with wary eyes mutters, "I'm super grateful for that information..." 
14.2.H.0.jpg;  Dozens of dolls with red eyes and unnerving grins stare leftward, a chilling message hanging above them: "Ready or not-" and below, "So now what? What will you do, when you only have 2 coins?".
14.2.H.1.jpg; Three such dolls, clad in blue, white, and green dresses, seem to beckon with a haunting "Come- and- find- us-." while a desperate voice whispers, "What do you mean, what? I'll die first, think later."
14.3.A.jpg;  Perched confidently on a railing, a red-haired man in white shrugs off the question, "You think your aura will exponentially grow if you die here?" 
14.3.B.jpg;  A single hand points skyward, accompanied by a challenging statement: "Guess the right doll immediately, which is a one-in-a-million chance."
14.3.C.0.jpg;  The brown-haired man in the green hoodie gapes in astonishment as a voice advises, "Or get so good at using your aura that you can last in this flame until you find the real doll."
14.3.C.1.jpg;  A bandaged hand reaches out, the owner hidden from view except for a glimpse of the green hoodie and brown hair as they glance back in fear.
14.3.D.0.jpg;  Smirking with red-rimmed eyes, the man in the green hoodie stands with hands in his pockets opposite the seated, white-clad man, who offers a peace sign as a voice mocks, "Yet you only bet 2 coins like an idiot? You probably can't do it."
14.3.D.1.jpg;  The man in the green hoodie turns away, a smug look on his face as he counters, "You forgot about option 3."
14.3.E.0.jpg;  Holding his breath, the man in the green hoodie clenches his fist, determination etched on his face as he declares, "Let's see who will win, after I die." 
14.3.E.1.jpg;  Desperation etched on his face, the man in the green shirt sprints with all his might, flames licking at his heels, a timer appearing below: "My aura will run out in."
14.3.F.jpg;  He skids to a halt before a group of children huddled within a fiery circle, his eyes darting frantically as the seconds count down - "10 seconds" - and he mutters, "Why don't I just grab a random one?"
14.3.G.0.jpg;  Among them, a young girl in a pink dress bites her lip, her eyes wide with worry.
14.3.G.1.jpg;  Another girl, with mischievous green eyes and a red shirt, peeks out, asking playfully, "Will you play with me?"
14.3.H.jpg;  "Got it." the man breathes, scooping the girl in the red dress into his arms, shielding her from the inferno. 
14.3.I.0.jpg;  Her eyes widen in terror.
14.3.I.1.jpg;  Suddenly, she cries out, "Bzzt!" as a surge of energy erupts from her.
14.3.J.0.jpg;  A hand reaches down, pulling her free from a sticky substance as she yells frantically, "I'm not it! I'm not it! I'm not it! I'm not it!"
14.3.J.1.jpg;  Her small face contorts in fear, still repeating, "I'm not it! I'm not it! I'm not it! I'm not it!"
14.3.K.0.jpg;  Gripped by panic, the man in the green hoodie stumbles back, clutching a chain. "I'm... not... it... I..." 
14.3.K.1.jpg;  He cries out, "I... i... i..." as his body begins to melt, viscous liquid dripping down his face, consumed by the red structure. 
14.3.L.jpg;  "3 seconds." the clock ticks down, flames swirling around the man in the green hoodie as the circle of children trapped with him scream in terror. 
14.4.A.0.jpg;  "...did they really have to put on this kind of show?" a voice mutters, and the man in the green hoodie peeks out from behind a tall, red-haired man with a stoic expression. 
14.4.A.1.jpg;  He clutches at his chest, his face wracked with pain, as if an invisible force crushes him. "How could one possibly understand the great tower?" echoes a chilling question. 
14.4.B.0.jpg;   "It's a psychopath that gives a cheat-like skill to a little shitling like you." he spits, rage contorting his face as he glares at the unseen accuser, children shrinking back from his fury.
14.4.B.1.jpg;  Exhaustion washes over him, the fire a dull roar compared to the turmoil inside. "Do you really have to say it like that...?" he mumbles, staring at the ground.
14.4.C.0.jpg;  "I second." a voice cuts through the air, and the man in the green hoodie winces, shards of glass reflecting his terrified face. 
14.4.C.1.jpg; He throws out a hand, a strangled cry escaping his lips as the golden chandelier blazes behind him: "Ahhhh!" 
14.4.D.0.jpg;  The room, once opulent with gold trim, is now an inferno, flames consuming everything in their path.
14.4.D.1.jpg; A lone figure in a green hoodie races through the blaze, desperately seeking an escape. 
14.4.E.0.jpg;  "Ahhhh!" A searing pain rips through him as a voice booms, "Time's up, zombie. It burns!"
14.4.E.1.jpg;  Flames engulf his vision.  "Burns!" the voice echoes, filled with righteous fury. "And you're a pervert that exceeds the tower."
14.4.F.0.jpg;  "No matter how great a hunter you want to be, to willingly go for a plan where you burn to death!" The red-haired man howls in anguish.
14.4.F.1.jpg;  Then, a chilling laugh escapes him. "I'll acknowledge you, Kim Zombie! You're a real pervert!" he wheezes between chuckles. "Ahhhh ahhhh!"
14.4.G.1.jpg;  A blue box materializes, stark against the darkness. "You have died."
14.4.H.jpg;  The man in the green sweater sits up, eyes wide with disbelief. Above him, the blue box announces: "The condition for your skill has been fulfilled by your death."  "Phew!" he exhales, a shaky laugh escaping his lips.
14.4.I.jpg;  His expression hardens, a determined glint in his eye.  "Randomly copying monster hellfire maiden's skills." the blue box declares. He points a finger, a steely glint in his eyes. "You didn't forget our promise, right?!"
14.5.A.0.jpg;  "I remember! Don't worry." the red-haired man scoffs, tossing cards into the air. "Do I seem like some petty ass bitch that'll break his promise? Wow!"
14.5.A.1.jpg;  He flips upside down, a gold card clutched in his hand. "Damn! This is amazing!" the man in the green hoodie cries, staring upward in awe.
14.5.B.0.jpg;  A yellow box appears, outlining the terrifying power he now wields: "Hellfire Barrier. Rank: S-. Effects: Grudge, Resentment, Regret... Your unending grudge, your unheard resentment, your unfulfilled regret. Burn all of it. 'It burns.' Is it hot? Burn the world to ashes. 'I feel like I'm dying.' Then kill. As long as you desire, an aura of hellfire will descend within a radius of 2km (1.25 miles). Without your permission, no one may escape this hell. No matter who it is." 
14.5.B.1.jpg;  A voice whispers urgently, "This is the one. Just shut up and pick this. This is the only S-rank skill this boss monster has, anyways."
14.5.C.jpg;  "Whenever you want, the hellfire from earlier will go boom!!!" the red-haired man grins, extending a hand, palm out.
14.5.D.jpg;  He frowns, his expression turning serious.  "Why are you acting like that?"
14.5.E.jpg;  The man in the green hoodie crosses his arms, a flicker of unease crossing his face.  "Is something wrong?" "No, it's just..." He hesitates. "I don't know why, but something doesn't feel right."
14.5.F.jpg;  "What is it?" a voice asks gently. The girl, still covered in goo, shakes her head desperately.  "I'm not it!"
14.5.G.0.jpg;  "Sitting right with me..."  The words hang in the darkness. "Anyways, please read the other..."
14.5.G.1.jpg;  "I don't get you... but as you wish." the man in the green hoodie says, staring up in bewilderment as the red-haired man sails through the air, delivering a powerful kick.
14.6.A.jpg;  A list of skills appears, stark and official: "[Labyrinth Architect] Rank A-, [Puppeteering] Rank B, [Remote Control] Rank B-, [Trap Installation] Rank C..." 
14.6.B.jpg; The red-haired man rests his arms behind his head, four silver cards orbiting him as he ponders.  "The last one is-"
14.6.C.0.jpg;  The man in the green hoodie gasps, eyes widening as he sees something off-screen. 
14.6.C.1.jpg; The red haired man, face flushed, yells "...!!!!!" in anger and frustration. 
14.6.D.0.jpg; The man in the green hoodie turns slightly, a sly look on his face as the red haired man says "that's what I thought."  "Wait, gong-ja!" he adds, suspicious. 
14.6.D.1.jpg; "H-hear me out!!" the red haired man shouts, face red with fury, dressed in his karate gi, "It's fine, I already get what kind of skill it is."
14.6.E.0.jpg;  The red haired man excitedly holds up a golden card. "Look at this! Wow! A golden card!" he exclaims. "So epic! If you got this one, hellfire barriers would go boom kablam!"
14.6.E.1.jpg;  The red haired man floats, looking up at the man in the green hoodie. "No matter who it is, your hellfire would charm them like powpow-" he begins.  The man in the green hoodie stares seriously up at him. "No. This is the card I truly wanted."
14.6.F.jpg; "I thought something was weird from the get-go." the man in the green hoodie says, a sly look on his face.
14.6.G.jpg; A single white figure kneels among tens of thousands of black figures.  "Among tens of thousands of them, there is only one real doll." echoes above them.  "The real one wouldn't burn since it's its [fire] aura."  a voice adds from below. 
14.6.H.jpg;  A hand clad in green reaches up to the sky.  "But why weren't the fake dolls burning?"
14.6.I.0.jpg; The red haired man, face grim, looks upward with determination.  "There is only one answer."
14.6.I.1.jpg; The man in the green hoodie faces the red haired man, holding up a card. 
14.6.J.0.jpg; "I thought there might be a skill that helped targets selected by the caster to 'not burn'..." the red haired man says with hope.  "Only you can prevent fire." the card reads.  "Rank: A  Ouch, it's hot! If you left something this hot alone, it could burn down your house. Well, worry no more. Any object or lifeform designated by you gains immunity to fire and can no longer burn. Enjoy your new life safe from the fear of the fire demon! However, damage from water and ice skills increases by 300%."
14.6.J.1.jpg; "Fucking hell... what a shitty ass game..." the man in the green hoodie groans, sprawled upside down, surrounded by twinkling lights.  The red haired man, also upside down, holds up a black belt. "Hahahaha! Repeat after me. 'Gong-ja-nim'! Come on!" 
14.7.A.0.jpg;  "Now, I can just go back and take a leisurely tour of the mansion until I find the doll." the upside down man in the green hoodie muses. "Damn, what shall I do? The game just got too easy."  "You are penalized by the skill." a message appears. 
14.7.A.1.jpg; "Wait... trauma?!" the man in the green hoodie cries as the red haired man hangs upside down above him. "Recreating trauma of an opponent that killed you." the message above him reads. "The level of the penalty is weak." it adds below the red haired man. "What in the..." the man in the green hoodie says, bewildered.
14.7.B.0.jpg; The bright blue sky is dotted with fluffy white clouds.  "Recreating the trauma of the monster hellfire maiden."
14.7.B.1.jpg;  A large, three-story house sits peacefully behind a black, wrought iron fence. 
15.1.A.jpg; A purple butterfly, wings glowing, flutters upwards, three glowing diamonds trailing below. "Sir, I'm so hungry." it calls out.
15.1.B.jpg; The man in the green shirt turns towards his door. A young girl with white hair stands in the doorway. "Could I get a piece of bread..." she asks, hands clasped. "Even just the crumbs..." she adds desperately.
15.1.C.jpg;  The young girl, terrified, runs down a set of stairs. "Why the fuck is a homeless kid the first thing I see in the morning?" a voice complains. 
15.1.D.0.jpg; A woman in a purple dress walks down the street.  "Just one piece of bread..." she pleads.  "Aren't there a lot of homeless kids in the neighborhood recently?" a man in a brown hat comments to a nearby woman. "It's okay even if it's moldy." the first woman says desperately. 
15.1.D.1.jpg;  A small child in a white hooded jacket walks through the street, head down. "Food is scarce because of the famine these days too..." someone says.  "I'm so hungry..." a man nearby adds.  "Sigh, annoying ass kids..." a third man grumbles, frowning deeply. 
15.1.E.jpg; Inside a dimly lit building, a silver haired man frowns, "Just one piece..." he mutters. "Where are they even coming from...?" a woman beside him asks, arms crossed.  A man in the middle looks at them, his face tense. 
15.1.F.jpg; "Can't someone just take them away or something?" the man in the green coat complains, frowning down at the silver haired child.  "Ow." the child whispers, a pained smile on their face. 
15.1.G.0.jpg; "I-i'm so sorry, sir...!" the man in the green coat stammers, hands thrown up in shock. The silver haired child beside him hides their face. 
15.1.G.1.jpg;  The silver haired child shrinks back, yellow eyes wide with fear, as a gloved hand reaches out to touch their hair. 
15.1.H.jpg; "Do you not have parents?" the red haired man asks sternly, reaching out a hand towards the silver haired child.  The child looks up at him, their expression heartbroken. 
15.2.A.jpg; "You seem hungry." a gentle voice says.  The silver haired child looks up, tears welling in their yellow eyes. "And your body is aching too, right?" 
15.2.B.jpg; "Come with me." the red haired man says with a sly smile, his eyes gleaming with mischief. 
15.2.C.0.jpg; A large, white building stands tall, a beacon of hope. "I'm a doctor." a voice announces. "And I have a lot of friends for you at home. I'll help."
15.2.C.1.jpg; "You feel better." the red haired man says over his shoulder as he and the silver haired child walk towards the large, welcoming building. 
15.2.D.jpg;  The massive metal gate, bathed in white light, seems to radiate gratitude. "Thank you, kind sir..." is etched across its surface.
15.2.E.0.jpg;  "When can I go out and play...?" the man in the top hat murmurs sadly from his prison cell. 
15.2.E.1.jpg; "I'm so hungry..." the man whispers, clutching the bars of his cell. In the background, another man in a green coat and hat watches impassively.
15.2.F.jpg; "Be patient." the man in the green coat purrs, a sinister smile playing on his lips.
15.2.G.0.jpg; Polished black shoes click across the brick walkway.  "Only animals succumb to their urges." the man in the green coat declares. "Just because you were birthed by a beast, doesn't mean you should" 
15.2.G.1.jpg;  "mean you should be raised like one too." the man finishes, his foot coming to rest near the terrified face of a white-haired woman, trapped behind bars. 
15.2.H.jpg;  "I know you orphans very well." the man in the green coat says, a cruel smile twisting his features. He brandishes a knife, standing over a cowering woman bound in chains. 
15.3.A.0.jpg;  "You don't work because you say you're too young." a voice spits, filled with disgust. "And you spread diseases from village to village." 
15.3.A.1.jpg;  The man in the green coat throws back his head and laughs, his eyes glowing red. In his hand, he holds a bloody knife, standing over a young woman bound in chains. 
15.3.B.jpg;  "And I'm a nice man who has the duty of getting rid of kids like you." the man says, the sharp point of his knife inches from the terrified face of the white-haired woman. 
15.3.D.0.jpg;  The man in the black hat glares menacingly, a cloaked woman standing behind him. "The current famine is caused by these orphans!" he proclaims.
15.3.D.1.jpg;  Trapped in a cage, a young boy cowers as a mob of hooded figures surrounds him, torches held high. "They are witches' kids! The poison of our land! The dirt of our society!" they roar, their voices filled with hatred.
15.3.E.0.jpg;  A hooded figure raises a glowing stick towards the heavens, his face a mask of desperate hope. "We will sacrifice you to god and save this land!!!" 
15.3.E.1.jpg;  A grey-haired man stares in horror, his hands raised in a futile attempt to protect himself.
15.3.F.0.jpg;  "Die!!!" the mob screams, their faces contorted with rage, a torch illuminating their bloodlust. 
15.3.F.1.jpg;  "Kill them!!!!" a lone figure shouts, his fist clenched, his face a mask of pure hatred. 
15.3.G.jpg;  A splatter of red stains the black, accompanied by a single, chilling word: "Ahahahahaaah". 
15.4.A.jpg;  "Kind sir." a voice calls out from the shadows.  A young boy sits in a cage, his shoulders slumped in despair.  "The number of sacrifices is dwindling." the voice continues, "We should get a couple more before the next ritual."
15.4.B.jpg;   "Taking our friends?" a voice asks from below.  Above, a pair of legs dangles lifelessly, a bloody baseball bat and hammer lying discarded on the ground. 
15.4.C.0.jpg;  "Why do you keep on hurting us?" a voice cries out from inside one of the cages.  Chains hang ominously from the ceiling. "Why...?" whispers a young boy trapped within. 
15.4.C.1.jpg;  A man in a green hoodie stands on a tiled floor, his gaze fixed on the ground where two knives and a broken baseball bat lie amidst bloodstains. "If the other hunters get to it first, our profits would dwindle." he says to the man trapped in a cage, who stares up at him with terror in his eyes. 
15.4.D.0.jpg;  Suddenly, the man in the green hoodie finds himself in a dark room with brick walls, his face etched with shock and disbelief. "Wow.. what the fuck is this?" he exclaims, turning to the source of a voice. "Were you.. also watching?" it asks.  "I was here from the start." another voice replies from his right, "I didn't know you were in here."
15.4.D.1.jpg;  The man in the green hoodie hangs his head, resting his forehead on his hand, accepting his fate as a man with long red hair stands behind him. "Either." the red-haired man says. "I guess we're both just animas right now."
15.4.E.0.jpg;  A man with short pink hair stares up in confusion and anger. "Well, that's not that important." a voice booms. "What kind of crazy fuckery is this?!" he yells back, his anger rising. "Who is he telling to repent?"
15.4.E.1.jpg;  The man in the green hoodie watches with a worried expression as the red-haired man turns, revealing sharp teeth in an angry snarl. 
15.4.F.jpg;  He turns his back to the red-haired man, fear gripping him as he takes in the dark, brick walls and the blood staining the floor. "This is probably.. the 'origin' of the boss on stage 10." a voice echoes around him. 
15.4.G.jpg;  A wave of surprise washes over him as he reads the text floating before him. "Trauma of your killer." it reads above a single line of dialogue. "I had no idea. I didn't know..." "That monsters used to be humans."
15.5.A.jpg;  He finds himself in another room, this one inhabited by a man with long red hair kneeling on the ground in a white shirt and pants, a hammer and knife discarded before him. "Not all monsters, though. Generally just bosses." a voice tells him. "Boss monsters are made based on real life events from different worlds."
15.5.B.jpg;  The man in the green hoodie whirls around, his face a mixture of shock and anger. "They're all otherworldly lifeforms, heroes, etc." the voice continues.  "And it only becomes more frequent after the 11th floor."  "Why didn't you tell me that before...?" he demands. 
15.5.C.jpg;  The red-haired man keeps his head bowed. "You never asked." 
15.5.D.0.jpg; In the dimly lit jail cell, the man in the green hoodie clutches his stomach. "I'm hungry..." he mutters. "But this is my first time seeing the 'origin'." he adds, glancing at the unconscious man in a white karate uniform slumped against the wall. 
15.5.D.1.jpg; A man in a black suit with slicked-back blonde hair walks solemnly down a dark hallway, a flickering candle illuminating his path. "Is anyone here...?" he asks.  "I knew that they were from other worlds." he continues, his gaze fixed on the door ahead, "but there was never a way to find out what had actually happened to them."
15.5.E.0.jpg;  The darkness presses down, heavy and suffocating. "It's different looking at it myself..." a voice whispers, the words tinged with sorrow. "Fucking shit."
15.5.E.1.jpg;  A burst of movement shatters the quiet as the man in the black suit spins around, kicking the man in the green hoodie with brutal force. The red-haired man watches in surprise, his eyes wide. 
15.5.F.jpg; The man in the green hoodie stumbles back, his eyes widening in fear as a hand materialized from thin air, a lit candle illuminating a pale face. "This always happen." a voice whispers, the words hanging in the air. 
15.5.G.0.jpg;  Flames roar, engulfing everything in their path. "Fire!!!" a voice screams over the crackling inferno. "Somewhere in every world?" 
15.5.G.1.jpg; Panic erupts as people rush down the hallway, their faces etched with fear.  "Wait!!!" a man in a white robe yells, pushing his way against the tide. "Hurry, leave the mansion!!" another voice shouts from the back. "Grab all the valuables before you leave!"
15.7.A.1.jpg;  A heavy silence hangs in the air as the man in the black shirt sits on the edge of the bed, his gaze fixed on his hands. Behind him, a man with long red hair watches silently. 
15.7.B.jpg;  The red-haired man stares intently at the slumped figure on the bed, his brow furrowed in thought. "Hm..." he murmurs. 
15.7.C.jpg;  The man in the black shirt turns, his expression strained. "I know it's a depressing situation." the man in the white karate outfit says. "but there's nothing we can do about it now." "Wow, is that really the first thing you're going to say...?"  the man in the black shirt replies. 
15.7.D.jpg;  The red-haired man glares, his expression hardening. "But what are you going to do about it? That's how the real world works!" he spits. "Yeah! I have a shitty personality."
15.7.E.jpg;  The man with the bandaged hand runs a hand through his hair, worry etched on his face. "That boss is now just a monster, and the kids from that 'origin' are all dead." he says. "For a long time now, too! What can you do about it!?"
15.7.F.0.jpg;  The red-haired man scowls, his gaze fixed on the floor. "Find the real doll and kill it." a voice commands. "But this is from another world!" he protests. "No one here can do anything about it!"
15.7.F.1.jpg;  He crosses his arms, his expression stormy as the man with the bandaged hand fixes him with a challenging stare. 
15.7.G.0.jpg;  A figure shrouded in shadow stands at the top of a staircase, red dots swirling ominously around him. "Then move on to floor 11!" a voice booms. 
15.7.G.1.jpg; He ascends the stairs, his steps measured and determined.  "20, 30, 40, 50! This is what you have to do now that you've decided to climb the tower." the voice continues. "If you want to reign from the top, then figure things like this out yourself!"
15.7.H.0.jpg; The man in the red jacket stands silently, his back to the viewer, as if deep in thought. "That's probably how..." he begins. 
15.7.H.1.jpg;  He continues up the stairs, his gaze fixed on the steps ahead. "The Flame Emperor thought too." a voice agrees from beside him. 
15.8.A.0.jpg;  The red-haired man turns, his expression grim. "Yoo Soo-ha would have 100% found the doll and killed it." he states. "Whether he saw the trauma or not. With no hesitation."
15.8.A.1.jpg; The man in the green hoodie stands with his back to him, his shoulders tense as the red-haired man continues to speak. "So what?" he asks. 
15.8.B.0.jpg; Standing on the rooftop, the man in the green hoodie stares out at the sprawling cityscape, his shoulders slumped. "I don't want to be like that bastard." he mutters. "So what are you gonna do?" a voice echoes from the building behind him. 
15.8.B.1.jpg;  The woman with red hair throws her hands up in exasperation.  "Are you a child!?" she exclaims, rounding on the man in the green hoodie. "Are you not going to clear the floor because you don't want to be like him!?"
15.8.C.jpg;  He glares at the metal bars in front of him, his jaw clenched tight.  "You have to get rid of the boss if you want to clear the stage, you dumbass zombie!" the woman yells. "Says who?" he shoots back, defiance blazing in his eyes.
15.8.D.0.jpg; He lunges, landing a solid punch on the red-haired man, who stumbles back in surprise. "Damn it! I was so stupid..." he groans, his anger tinged with regret. 
15.8.D.1.jpg; The red-haired man recovers quickly, his expression hardening as he faces him. "What are you talking about?" he demands. 
15.8.E.0.jpg; "I'm saying I'm stupid! And so are you." the man in the green hoodie yells back. 
15.8.E.1.jpg;  He turns away, his shoulders slumping as a wave of despair washes over him. "God damn it! Everything was laid out for me, but I didn't even notice!!"
15.8.F.0.jpg;  A voice breaks the silence, heavy with meaning. "Remember the S-class skill you told me to choose?"  "Who do you think I am..." another voice replies, laced with amusement. "Of course I do."
15.8.F.1.jpg;  The red-haired man crosses his arms, his annoyance evident in the set of his jaw. 
15.8.G.jpg;  A man in a long black robe walks slowly, his gloved hand clasped around the wrist of a young woman with long white hair. "Grudge, resentment, regret." he murmurs. 
15.9.A.jpg; A distressed man in a striped uniform suffers, chained within a dark cell as a message hangs above: "your unending grudge, your unheard resentment, your unfulfilled regret...burn all of it." 
15.9.B.0.jpg; An ominous statement hangs in the air: "as long as you desire, an aura of hellfire will descend within a radius of 2km 1.25 miles...without your permission, no one may escape this hell. no matter who it is."
15.9.B.1.jpg; Leaning against a wall, a sad man with black hair in a dark green hoodie is questioned, "don't you think something is wrong?"
15.9.C.0.jpg;  An irritated man with red hair and a beard, dressed in a white uniform, looks to the side and demands, "what are you talking about? what's wrong with the skill? ...the final part." 
15.9.C.1.jpg;  The man with black hair, now clad in a green jacket, reddens with anger as the words hang in the air: "without your permission, no one may escape this hell. no matter who it is."
15.9.D.jpg;  Holding a walkie-talkie, a serious woman with black hair in a black jacket questions, "then how did the black dragon guild escape without killing the boss?"
15.9.E.jpg;  Arms outstretched in surrender, the man with the green hoodie mutters, "...i don't know. i'm not sure."
15.9.F.0.jpg; Below a large chandelier engulfed in flames, a chilling realization emerges: "there's only 1 possibility... the boss allowed them to leave!"
15.9.F.1.jpg;  The man in the green hoodie stands before the flames, glancing over his shoulder at the figures within the fire. 
15.9.G.0.jpg;  A mischievous young woman with blonde hair and large eyes, adorned in a red and white dress, peers down at the flames below, giggling softly, "teeheeheeheehee."  Above her, the words "has yet to clear" hang in the air. 
15.9.G.1.jpg;  Standing on a white platform beneath a candle chandelier, a man with short black hair in a green jacket and jeans faces a crowd, their eyes fixed on him as a single word escapes them, "teeheeheehee."
15.10.A.jpg;  Bathed in an unsettling orange light, two girls sit, one in a black dress and blue hat, the other in brown, their smiles strained as a voice calls out, "play with us!"
15.10.B.0.jpg; In the darkness, a man with black hair narrows his eyes, a serious expression etched on his face as if steeling himself, "okay...let's play..."
15.10.B.1.jpg; He smiles broadly, hands raised, glowing with an eerie orange light.
15.10.C.0.jpg;  Within a room, beneath a grand chandelier and a looming window, flames dance as a message appears: "[activating skill: [only you can prevent fire]]."
15.10.C.1.jpg;  The man in the green jacket strides down a hallway, followed by a line of watchful eyes.
15.10.D.jpg; Two dolls, one in green and white, the other in white and yellow, share a look of shock, their words tumbling over each other, "huh?...that man isn't burning...isn't it hot?"
15.10.E.jpg;  He flashes a nervous smile at a girl in a yellow dress beside him, "so you can play with us?....yep!" 
15.10.F.0.jpg; With a serious expression, a man with brown hair observes the inferno behind him, a voice booming, "it's hide-and-seek, right? Watch out! ... I've never lost a game of hide-and-seek in my life!"
15.10.F.1.jpg;  A confident smirk plays on the lips of a green-haired man in a green hoodie as he stands before a crowd of wide-eyed dolls, a nervous whisper escaping them, "it's a weird old man!!" 
15.10.G.0.jpg; Covering his eyes, the man in the green hoodie smiles playfully, calling out, "Hurry! Everyone, hide! ... I'm gonna get you soon! A game of hide-and-seek with kids who couldn't go anywhere."
15.10.G.1.jpg;  "Hide well- let's go hide super far!  Somewhere he'll never find us! Don't get caught by him!" cry the terrified children as they scatter,  a man in a white karate uniform floating menacingly above, while the man in the green hoodie joins them, covering his eyes.
15.11.A.0.jpg;  Anxiety washes over the man in the green hoodie as he calls out, hand outstretched,  "Okay! I'm looking now!"
15.11.A.1.jpg;  A child in white pants and a black jacket,  a blue ribbon bobbing in their hair,  looks up in fear, hand raised,  "I got you!  Nope! It's not me!"
15.11.B.jpg; Frustration mounts as the man in the green hoodie, a small child in his arms, searches,  a chorus of voices rising around him,  "Hey! Is it you?... Nope, not me! How about you?... Not me either!... Nope."
15.11.C.jpg; "Hm, it's harder than I thought... is it you, then?" he wonders aloud, placing a hand on the head of a red-haired child in the circle of expectant faces, "Nope! Try again!" 
15.11.D.jpg;  Disappointment clouds the face of a man with long red hair in a white shirt as he turns back to look at three long, tongue-like objects lying on the floor.
15.11.E.0.jpg; An empty doorway stands open, a golden candlestick glimmering nearby, as a voice whispers, "Hey, are you...appeasing their spirits?" 
15.11.E.1.jpg;  Five children, their faces beaming, sit on a red carpet, ankles adorned with bracelets, one kneeling beside another, gently touching their hair.
15.11.F.jpg;  Flames lick at the staircase behind them as four children look up, fear etched on their faces, towards a man in a green hoodie, a gentle hand resting on one child's head.  "Nope! Not me!" calls a voice, "It's not me, too!" 
15.11.G.jpg;  "Not me!" the man in the green hoodie cries out, crouching low on the stone stairs as a girl with melting red hair sits behind him, a small boy with blonde hair clinging to his knees, eyes wide with fear, as flames lick at the bottom of the steps. 
15.11.H.jpg;  "Nope! Not yet! ... Me neither!" echoes through the desolate passage as the man in the green jacket hurries away, a small girl in a pink dress clutched in his arms, flames raging beside them.
15.11.I.0.jpg;  "...are you...." a voice trails off, the only sound in the stillness surrounding a lonely wooden cage.
15.11.I.1.jpg; Inside, a small child with grey hair and mischievous yellow eyes sits within the metal bars, their blue and white dress a stark contrast to the cold grey floor. 
15.12.A.jpg; A young girl with short silver hair, a mischievous glint in her one open yellow eye, the other stitched shut, stares ahead, a black bow tie contrasting sharply with her light blue dress and dark red lipstick. 
15.12.B.jpg;  Crouching beside a wooden cage, the man in the green hoodie peers down at a small girl with silver hair in a blue and white striped dress, her expression uncertain as he asks, "Going to play with us?"
15.12.C.jpg;  A child with white hair and yellow eyes, clad in a blue dress, flinches as an unseen hand strokes their head, the words "...I got you" hanging in the air. 
15.12.D.jpg;  A confident smirk spreads across the face of the man in the green hoodie, "You're it." he declares, looking off to the side. 
15.12.E.jpg;  Confusion washes over the child with white hair and yellow eyes as they look up, startled, an unseen hand still resting on their head.
15.12.F.0.jpg; "Kind sir." a voice calls out as a child with white hair and yellow eyes cries, face stained with a viscous liquid, their expression a mixture of shock and despair as an unseen hand wipes at the dripping substance. 
15.12.F.1.jpg;  Slumped in a blue dress, a baby cries silently, saliva dripping from their chin, their tiny hands clenched tight, a picture of sadness and helplessness. 
15.12.G.0.jpg;  A boy with white hair throws his head back and beams, an unnervingly wide smile revealing sharp canines as an unseen hand hovers above him, a disturbing juxtaposition of innocence and something more sinister. 
15.12.G.1.jpg;  "Thank you." the man murmurs, his grey shirt the only visible feature as he stands with his back to the viewer, a sense of quiet gratitude emanating from him.
15.12.H.jpg; Despair hangs heavy in the air as two men stand within a prison cell, one kneeling, feeding a piece of fabric to a flickering fire, the other, his red hair a stark contrast to the gloom, staring down at the floor, a heavy chain dangling from the ceiling.
16.1.A.0.jpg;  On a futuristic screen, a message glows: "Cleared by party of 1, Hunter Gong-ja. Calculating clear rewards... complete." 
16.1.A.1.jpg;  Two men, one in a green jacket, the other in white with red hair, stand before a towering building, bare branches framing the message hovering above: "Rewards will be redeemable 24 hours later, once you enter floor 11."
16.1.B.jpg;  "...why the long face?" a voice asks as a man with dark hair, his green hoodie blending with the verdant trees, walks with a heavy heart, his gaze cast down.
16.1.C.0.jpg;  "Clearing a hidden stage is something I barely did too." a voice calls out, tinged with pride, "but you did it in one try! You'll probably get nice rewards too." 
16.1.C.1.jpg;  "Sigh...you probably won't get it." the man in the white martial arts uniform states, hand outstretched towards the dejected figure in the green hoodie, who stands head bowed, "you don't have a heart."
16.1.D.jpg;  "I just feel like...the world kind of sucks." the man in the green hoodie mutters, hand covering his mouth as he stares ahead, lost in bleak contemplation. 
16.1.E.jpg;  "The scene we saw at the boss stage. Things like that happen no matter what world you're in." 
16.1.F.jpg;  The man in the ripped karate uniform frowns. "... I mean, that is just how life is."
16.1.G.jpg;  The two men walk solemnly side by side.
16.1.H.jpg;  "Ahhhh! Whatever! I'm not fit for things like this!" The man with red hair screams, clutching his head as the other man watches. 
16.2.A.jpg;  "By the way, I'm pretty impressed! Clearing the stage in your own unique way! It's a compliment!"  He places a hand on the confused man's shoulder. 
16.2.B.jpg;  "This is kinda sus....?"  The man in the karate uniform smirks confidently.  "Hey man, I can recognize a great man when I see one. You got through this stage on pure skill and no luck." 
16.2.C.0.jpg;  "And besides, we're partners! I should be happy for you!"
16.2.C.1.jpg;  He spreads his arms wide, looking at his partner. 
16.2.D.1.jpg;  "[This is a public service announcement." His face is shocked as he stares past his partner. 
16.2.E.jpg;  [Floor 10 has been cleared.  
16.2.F.0.jpg;  Brightly colored fireworks explode across the night sky.
16.2.F.1.jpg;  "[Floor 11 will open in 24 hours.]" The city waits below the announcement.
16.2.G.jpg;  Three people look up at the display.  "Anon 1 second ago What's going on? What's with the fireworks?"
16.2.H.jpg;   "Anon 1 second ago They're shooting fireworks. Is this on all floors or just the 1st?" Someone stares up in awe at the purple and white fireworks. 
16.3.A.jpg;  Even a large man in the forest is mesmerized by the show.  "Anon 1 second ago I'm on the third floor and there're fireworks here too."
16.3.B.0.jpg;  "24:00:00" flashes across the sky. "Anon 1 second ago Did anyone see the announcement that floor 10 was cleared?"
16.3.B.1.jpg;  "Anon 1 second ago Was it black dragon? But where was their announcement?" The man in the green hoodie checks his phone.  "Anon 1 second ago The hunter association had said that they would clear it in 2 weeks."
16.3.C.jpg;   "It's finally time to enter the main story." The light intensifies. "23:59:58" 
16.3.D.jpg;   "I've seen something similar in my past life." The red-haired man stares intently at the other, who thoughtfully watches the fireworks. 
16.3.E.jpg;   "This is my second time too."  Four people gather near a window, some looking out at the fireworks, others at their phones. 
16.3.F.0.jpg; "If the other hunters get to it first, our profits would dwindle." He nervously eyes his phone. "Anon it's not black dragon. Black dragon's rankers are in a cafe on the first floor. Photo attached." 
16.3.F.1.jpg; "Anon I'm at the shrine right now. And it's also not the heresy inquisitor."  His jaw drops, pointing at the message as the priests behind him look on.  
16.3.G.0.jpg; "Anon None of the guilds cleared it? Then isn't it the sword saint?  Anon The sword saint is currently drinking milk next to me. Photo attached."  "WTF does this mean?" 
16.3.G.1.jpg;   "Anon This doesn't make any sense. Anon No one knows who cleared it? Anon Then who was it?"
16.3.H.jpg;  "How does it feel to be promoted from a random extra to a main character?"  He smirks, arms crossed confidently. 
16.4.A.0.jpg;  Fireworks paint the sky as the young man gazes upward thoughtfully. 
16.4.A.1.jpg;  "It's fucking great."  He smirks, pleased with himself. 
16.4.B.jpg;  "I feel like the world is mine. Right?"  A smug grin spreads across his face. 
16.4.C.jpg;   "Don't get ahead of yourself, though. All you did was clear floor 10." 
16.4.D.0.jpg;   "But. You're the man closest to the top."  He smiles confidently as the other man smirks down at the floor. "I know." 
16.4.D.1.jpg;  "Mister Hunter! Mi.... And all that's left is actually getting there."  He races after the fleeing man in the helmet.
16.4.E.jpg;  "Just now... are you the one who did it?" The armored man yells furiously. 
16.4.F.jpg;   "C-clearing the tenth floor!!!! I don't know what you're talking about."  He stares in confusion. 
16.4.G.jpg;  *Ding. Ding.* "You're the only one who challenged floor 10 today... M-my upper management is going crazy. They're demanding to know what's going on..."
16.5.A.jpg;  "What if I did clear it?" He asks the stunned man in the silver armor. 
16.5.B.0.jpg; "Uh? W-well... I just wanted to ask you for your na... 'Just'? Even though you even got 100 gold from me?"
16.5.B.1.jpg;  "Please tell me your alias at the least!!!" He waves desperately. 
16.5.C.jpg;  "I don't have one." He walks away. 
16.5.D.jpg;  "Ha, look at his face." The man in armor runs ahead excitedly. 
16.5.E.0.jpg;  "Good job. That's how you make yourself more known. Hide who you are, and make them work to find you."  He smiles at his companion. 
16.5.E.1.jpg;   "I think I figured something out."  He sits back serenely, a small smile playing on his lips as the other man frowns. 
16.5.F.jpg; "What did you figure out? [Please state the floor you want to transfer to.] Why you're complimenting me all of a sudden..." He stretches casually as the red-haired man glowers. 
16.5.G.0.jpg;  "You swore to call me Gong-ja-nim! If I cleared it within 2 coins, right?!  Wow! Isn't it crazy that I cleared it within"  He grins triumphantly. 
16.5.G.1.jpg; "Cleared it within 2 coins?!  Hey, Gong-ja, we're partners, right..." His eyes gleam menacingly. 
16.5.H.0.jpg; "Think about it... Partners should be equal in status! You and me! Equal! Someone who cleared floor 99 and his partner, the person who will clear floor 100! A partner! A friend! Wow. Isn't that beautiful! Floor 1."
16.5.H.1.jpg;  "[Moving to floor 1"  He smirks, touching his ear.  "Gong-ja-?!?!"
16.5.I.0.jpg;  "Shush, add the -nim if you want to talk to me from now on."  He smiles confidently.
16.5.I.1.jpg;  "Forever!"  He walks through a ring of light, hand outstretched behind him as another reaches for him. 
16.5.J.jpg;  A bright light shines, full of promise.  
16.5.K.jpg;  "Who's the one who cleared floor 10? I keep checking the news, but it's not showing up... Do you think black dragon is hiding the fact that they cleared it?!"  The mystery remains unsolved. 
16.6.A.jpg; A man in a blue jacket sips his drink as a woman gestures emphatically towards him, "no, i'm telling you that it's the sword saint!" 
16.6.B.jpg;  The man smiles serenely into his cup, "what do you think, sword emperor? ...isn't victory sweet? just like this caramel macchiato..."
16.6.C.jpg; He lifts a hand to his ear, his brow furrowed in confusion, "hm? are my earphones broken? i don't hear an answer."
16.6.D.jpg;  A man with fiery red hair glares downwards, fist clenched, as a string of greetings hangs in the air: "hello? ...mr. sword emperor ...sir psychopath ...mr crazy??"
16.6.E.0.jpg; The man with the earphones smiles brightly, a hint of surprise in his eyes as the red-haired man behind him growls, "......yes?"
16.6.E.1.jpg; He grins at someone off-screen, "wow, i can hear you again i thought you went deaf for a second...  you shouldn't make the 'very respectable sir gong-ja' worry, right?"
16.6.F.0.jpg;  The red-haired man glowers, "and also, can i speak comfortably with you, swordy boy? it'll be weird if i use honorifics while you call me sir gong-ja, right?" 
16.6.F.1.jpg;  His face contorted in anguish, the red-haired man cries out, "just kill me!!!!!", as the man in the blue jacket watches him from across the table. 
16.6.G.0.jpg;  The man in the blue jacket stares downwards, a determined look on his face, "just copy a new skill and put it over the sword throne!!! ...i wanna go back to marcus!!!!!!"
16.6.G.1.jpg; He takes a sip from his cup, a playful smile on his face, "that's a funny joke! aren't we partners for life?" as the red-haired man beside him smiles too. 
16.6.H.jpg;  The sky shimmers, painted with clouds and stars as a digital clock shines brightly, "22:32:50  ...it's been about an hour and a half. i think it's almost time_ ...togeth-eeeeeeeer forever."
16.7.A.jpg; In a cozy cafe with exposed brick walls, a man in a blue shirt enjoys his drink, lost in the music playing through his headphones. "!"
16.7.B.jpg;  A fluffy brown cat, collar bell jingling, looks up with an excited meow, "wow, i can't believe this high of a ranker would come in person... nyaa" 
16.7.C.jpg;  The man in the blue shirt chuckles, holding the cat gently against a cheerful, cat-themed background, "well, no one knows about this cat 'yet'. i guess i should pretend to not know, too. ...are you lost? do you wanna play with me? nyaan"
16.7.D.jpg;  His eyes widening in surprise, the man in the blue shirt looks up at the armored figure beside him, "i heard she was obsessed with cats, but this is some impressive acting... excuse me, but are you hunter kim gong-ja?" 
16.7.E.0.jpg; Inside the bustling cafe, five figures stand together, their faces serious and alert.
16.7.E.1.jpg;  The man with the headphones sits on the floor, lost in thought. "hm..."
16.7.F.jpg; He glances sideways, a knowing smirk playing on his lips as he holds up a Hunter ID card.  "i was wondering how long it would take, but it took exactly 1 hour and 30 minutes. ...hunter kim gong-ja"
16.7.G.jpg;  Across the street, a group huddles together, voices urgent. "we found him! ...in the cafe across the street from the bank...! ...don't worry! i won't let the other guilds take him!"
16.7.H.jpg;  A man in gleaming armor approaches the man in blue, a confident grin on his face as he points towards him. "nice to meet you. i'm a director of the civil militia guild. ...if you come to our guild-" 
16.7.I.jpg; A man in a white shirt wrings his hands, a nervous question mark hanging above his head, as a man in a suit stands behind him.  "i'm sorry to interrupt you, but let's go over some rules first. ...?"
16.7.J.jpg;  The man in the green jacket throws his hand up, face creased with worry.  "first, don't tell the media about my name. ...until when...? ...and the reporters are going crazy right now. there's a limit to how much we can hide..."
16.8.A.jpg;  A hand gives a confident thumbs-up to the man in the red jacket. "not for long."
16.8.B.0.jpg;  Settling back in his chair, the man in the blue sweater smiles down at the ginger cat nestled comfortably in his arms.
16.8.B.1.jpg;  He glances at the text floating above, "...just until the clock reaches 00:00:00.  ...i just don't want to run into reporters while trying to get to floor 11."
16.8.C.jpg;  The man in the black jacket nods curtly as the woman beside him beams.  "if that's all... ...and secondly." 
16.8.D.0.jpg;  "this is a public place, so let's respect the other customers." the man in the blue sweater says mildly, even as the woman beside him squirms under the attention. 
16.8.D.1.jpg;  A blond man snaps a picture with his phone as the woman in the background hides her face in her hands, her companion looking down awkwardly.
16.8.E.jpg; The man in the blue sweater clutches his mug and cat protectively, his face flushed. "e-excuse me-!!!" 
16.8.F.0.jpg; "we're from the hunter association. how much would it take to rent this cafe for an hour?" The woman in blue fixes her eyes on the cafe owner as the red-caped man behind her chimes in,  "hey, order some drinks too. 1 drink per person!" 
16.8.F.1.jpg; Beaming brightly, the man in the teal shirt spreads his arms wide. "thank you so much! if you come to the chun-moon guild* next time..."
16.8.G.jpg;  Three cups of coffee sit on the table, steam curling gently from their depths. "t/n: celestial martial arts clan. ...now."
16.8.H.jpg;  Six figures sit around a table, the air thick with anticipation.  "let's start negotiating. start the bid."
16.8.I.0.jpg;  The blond man whirls around, eyes wide with surprise, as the man in the suit behind him announces calmly, "...civil militia is willing to offer ten thousand gold as a signing bonus."
16.8.I.1.jpg;  The man in the suit leans back, a smug look on his face. "the militia's really flexing how broke they are. ...join the adventure guild! we will offer twenty thousand gold and an executive position!"
16.8.J.0.jpg;  The blond man slams his hands on the table.  "come to our chun-moon! ...we will give you the trainer role and 25k gold! ...a trainer's position is just a hassle! if you come to our omnipotent god guild, we will give you an honorary position!"
16.8.J.1.jpg; The man in the blue shirt leans forward, determination etched on his face, as the woman beside him nods firmly. "...the hunter association! please become our ambassador!!!"
16.8.K.0.jpg; Disbelief and frustration color the air.  "th-the militia... will offer 36k gold... ...the undisputed rank i without belonging to a guild.  ...can the broke guilds stop bidding? why are you even increasing it by the thousands?! ...an existence like that makes people question the importance of guilds.  ...the alchemist castle will..."
16.8.K.1.jpg;  The man in the blue shirt stares ahead, brow furrowed with concern, as two figures loom behind him. "if someone of his caliber suddenly shows up..."
16.9.A.0.jpg;  A hush falls over the room.  "sang-ryun. ...50k." 
16.9.A.1.jpg; In the quiet cafe, the two men chat as the woman in blue listens intently.
16.9.B.jpg;  Startled, a brown cat leaps from its perch, its gold collar glinting as it darts away. 
16.9.C.0.jpg;  Bathed in ethereal white light, a woman in a blue dress stands tall, her presence radiating power. "and the vice guild master position."
16.9.C.1.jpg;  The woman in yellow and blue stares, mouth agape, as the other woman smiles serenely.  "how is that? ...rank 3 [merchant union] guild master countess"
16.9.D.jpg;  The man in the navy sweater smiles to himself as he slips on his headphones. 
17.1.A.jpg;  The man in the blue sweater stares impassively ahead. "you've got some nerve. ...you don't seem that surprised even though a cat just turned into a lady..."
17.1.B.jpg;  The woman with the fan chuckles lightly, her eyes sparkling. "i tend to be like that. i see dead people too. ...hahaha, you also have a sense of humor."
17.1.C.jpg;  An astonished whisper hangs in the air. "i can't believe she's in her 40s.  ...she probably found a way to get her hands on the fountain of youth with her wealth."
17.1.D.jpg;  The blond man turns, a question in his eyes. "excuse me ryun-ju, but..."  "you're excused." the man in the navy sweater replies calmly, as the red-caped man leans forward attentively.  "t/n: ryun-ju means merchant leader and she goes by that name as well as countess"
17.1.E.0.jpg; The blond man's eyes widen in disbelief. "isn't 50k gold and the vice guild master position... a little too much? ...i know he's the first one to clear the 10th floor, ...but we... don't... know what..." 
17.1.E.1.jpg; The man with blonde hair clutches his waist, his face a mask of worry as he stares in shock at the woman with fear in her eyes. "know... what... ability..."
17.1.F.jpg;  He averts his gaze, clutching a white cup, his expression troubled as she fixes him with a neutral look. "are you done being excused?" "...yes."
17.1.G.0.jpg; A sly smile plays on her lips, her eyes burning with a quiet fury. "okay, now call your leaders out before i have to excuse you again."
17.1.G.1.jpg; Calmly, she stands, her expression unreadable, a closed fan held casually in one hand. 
17.1.H.0.jpg;  Light filters through the white blinds, casting long shadows on the brown wall, the air thick with anticipation. "unless there's someone here who can bid more than 50k gold."
17.1.H.1.jpg; He glances to the right, a neutral expression on his face as she stands with her arms crossed, a picture of relaxed authority. 
17.2.A.jpg; He shoots a worried look towards the source of the woman's sly smile. "that damn bitc... no, pussy!! they're here."
17.2.B.0.jpg; The older man charges forward, his face a grim mask, a black eye patch doing little to diminish his menacing aura.
17.2.B.1.jpg;  He throws a powerful punch, his fist clenched tight, his black and red outfit a blur of motion.  
17.2.C.jpg;  Rage contorts the older man's face, his teeth bared as he points accusingly. "fucking ryun-shit! fuck you!" 
17.2.D.jpg; A sly grin spreads across his face, his blue eyes gleaming with confidence. "you were a step ahead of us. i guess it's because i was slacking."
17.2.E.0.jpg;  He shrugs, a relaxed smile playing on his lips. "we weren't 'slacking' per se. our job is to keep the hunters in order, after all. ryun-ju is just ridiculously fast."
17.2.E.1.jpg; Arms folded, he stands with quiet determination, his gaze serious beneath the blue and gold helmet.  
17.2.F.jpg; A stern expression hardens her features, her silence speaking volumes. "...."
17.2.G.0.jpg;  He glares, his expression thunderous. "it's about time you came." 
17.2.G.1.jpg;  He swivels in his chair, eyes wide with shock. "these are the top rankers of the tower..." 
17.3.A.jpg;  She smiles brightly, oblivious to the look of disgust on the older man's face. "it's been a while since we've met up. it seems like it was just yesterday that we were clearing floor 2 together. i guess we're old now." "shut up before i make cat soup out of you."
17.3.B.0.jpg;  His jaw drops, eyes wide with astonishment. "50k gold? vice guild leader? i know wasting money is your hobby. but the vice guild master position.....?! wait! let's all order coffee first!" 
17.3.B.1.jpg; He gapes, utterly speechless, his surprise mirrored on the face of the blond man beside him. 
17.3.C.0.jpg;  Arms crossed, he fixes them with an annoyed look.  "it's rude to come into a shop and just loiter. we should be setting a good example for the rest of the hunters!" 
17.3.C.1.jpg;  He leans forward, a wide smile on his face. "i think i'd like a mocha coffee! how about you guys?"
17.3.D.0.jpg;  In the cozy cafe, the man in the helmet announces, "i'm in the mood for a cold latte." while the woman beside him chimes in with, "hazelnut latte. hot. extra shot. grande."
17.3.D.1.jpg;  "i'd like a warm americano please." she says with a smile, her eyes twinkling with amusement. 
17.3.E.0.jpg;  Bold letters scream across a green background, radiating anger and disbelief. "what?!?! the entire tower is in chaos because someone cleared floor 10, and you guys want to drink coffee? do your brains run on caffeine or something..." 
17.3.E.1.jpg;  A menacing grin spreads across his face, teeth bared. "so you want a strong espresso? coming right up." 
17.3.F.jpg; "excuse me! can you take our order?" he roars. while the blond man behind him mutters, "this goddamn religious nut! i'm not drinking it!"
17.3.G.jpg;  The barista's face crumples with worry as he scribbles frantically on his notepad. "yes, yes, so... one tall iced mocha coffee, one tall warm americano, one tall iced latte, one grande warm hazelnut latte and a shot of espresso..."
17.4.A.0.jpg;  The group sits in expectant silence, their faces a mixture of boredom and anticipation. "what will you be having?"
17.4.A.1.jpg;  His brow furrows, a wave of confusion washing over him. "they planned this whole thing out, huh?"
17.4.B.0.jpg; Red hair practically vibrates with fury as he glares at the floor. "all the guild leaders came after the executives left. that's not a coincidence. they coordinated this to mess with me." 
17.4.B.1.jpg; A comforting hand rests on his shoulder. "don't be scared. they're just trying to intimidate you."
17.4.C.jpg;  His eyes widen as he recalls a painful memory, a steely glint entering his gaze. "i know. this isn't much compared to being burned alive."
17.4.D.jpg; "Composure!" he squeaks, startled as the man across the table leans forward. "Excuse me, can I see the drink menu?"
17.4.E.0.jpg; He flashes an easy grin. "I just had a macchiato, so I'm not really feeling coffee right now. Could I get a hot chocolate?" "O-of course.." 
17.4.E.1.jpg;  He stares apprehensively at the table, the words echoing in his mind. "If I had an actual reason to not be afraid..."
17.4.F.jpg; A sly smile plays on his lips, his blue eyes glinting with curiosity. "Quite amazing that you haven't had any notable achievements before clearing floor 10.... did something change?"
17.4.G.0.jpg;  He sighs, running a hand through his red hair.  "I could just kill myself if something goes wrong." "Yeah! That's your greatest strength. Just kill yourself if something goes wrong!"
17.4.G.1.jpg;  He forces a smile, his eyes betraying his unease. "Thanks for the support, but you better keep your end of the deal." "Damn it..."
17.4.H.0.jpg;  She stifles a laugh, her eyes sparkling with amusement. "He has had one achievement. This youngster recently won our guild's lottery."
17.4.H.1.jpg;  She taps a finger thoughtfully against her cheek.  "He's pretty lucky. He also has guts. He probably also has some skill. A youngster with those three will succeed no matter what." 
17.5.A.0.jpg; He freezes, his hand flying to his ear, a look of dawning dread on his face. 
17.5.A.1.jpg;  "Did you think someone who cleared floor 10 would just be some newbie... I told y'all, let's just drop the act and recruit him!" 
17.5.B.jpg;  "Let's not waste time." he says, his expression hardening with determination. 
17.5.C.0.jpg;  She cuts him off.  "Stop talking about unrelated things. We can talk about that on our own time."
17.5.C.1.jpg;  Her eyes widen, her arms tightening around herself as the name hangs in the air. "Hunter Kim Gong-ja."
17.5.D.0.jpg;  The air crackles with tension. "Which guild are you interested in joining? If you plan on not joining a guild, tell us that too. We'll need time to make our positions clear to the..."
17.5.D.1.jpg;  "...clear to the media too." she finishes, her gaze unwavering.
17.5.E.jpg; He smirks, tilting his head arrogantly.  "...And what if I plan on joining one?"
17.5.F.0.jpg; She gestures towards the towering structure that dominates the skyline. "We've wasted far too much time on floor 9. But because of you, there's a reason to advertise the worth of the 'tower' to the outside world again. A chance to pull in people of all backgrounds from the outside world." 
17.5.F.1.jpg;  "...and a spark of motivation to all the hunters who've been contentedly sitting on the first floor. What lays beyond floor 11? Curiosity is one of the forces that power the 'tower'!" 
17.6.A.jpg; The man gestures with his hand concerned, "You're right. We're starting to reach the limit on how much food can be farmed below floor 9."
17.6.B.jpg; The woman, relaxing in her chair, says confidently, "I do keep a trade route open 24/7 to the outside world... but that's not enough. We need new products."
17.6.C.jpg;  With an intense look in her eyes, the purple-haired woman declares, "We have to pull hunters into the new world. We need people to explore and find things of value there."
17.6.D.0.jpg;  Standing with her back turned, the woman in red, holding a glowing object, states, "We need a way to appeal to the masses outside the tower. An 'icon' that symbolizes it's time for a revolution!!"
17.6.D.1.jpg;  Bathing in a bright light, the surprised woman exclaims, "Just like the flame emperor did. And you're saying that's me?" 
17.6.E.0.jpg; Looking down with concern, the white-haired woman reveals, "Black dragon tried to murder that 'icon.'  Was it the witch of 'black dragon'?"
17.6.E.1.jpg;  Gripped by the neck, she looks up in terror, whispering, "I don't know why, but if they were his enemy..."
17.6.F.0.jpg;  The man in the blue shirt smiles at the viewer, stating confidently,  "I'll probably vibe well with Black Dragon's guild leader."
17.6.F.1.jpg; Leaning forward slightly, the man declares, "I understand. The guild that recruits me will represent the new generation of hunters. And the other guilds won't be able to do anything about it."
17.6.G.jpg; With a determined look, the man with short brown hair announces to the group, "I'd feel bad if that happened, so let's do this." 
17.6.H.jpg;  A hand grips the Ace of Spades, a sense of urgency in the air. "If the other hunters get to it first, our profits would dwindle."
17.7.A.jpg;  Holding up a deck of cards, the black-haired man grins, "Poker cards? Let's play a game of poker.  I'll join the winning person's guild.  I don't need money or an executive position. However." he adds with a mischievous glint in his eye.
17.7.B.0.jpg;  Tension crackles between the two men as the one with an eye patch declares, "If I win, I will [multi-join] every guild at once."
17.7.B.1.jpg; The purple-haired woman's jaw drops in surprise, while the man with the fan chuckles at her reaction. 
17.7.C.jpg;  The man lays down a card, a confident smirk playing on his lips. "I'll look like a guild member to outsiders but receive equal treatment as all of you." 
17.7.D.0.jpg;  The woman in yellow smiles slyly, fanning herself with an air of casual power.
17.7.D.1.jpg;  A challenging voice rings out, "You want to receive the same treatment as us after clearing just 1 floor? Interesting. I'll take it."
17.7.E.0.jpg;  The blond man leans back, a confident smirk on his face. "If there are no tricks involved, then I'm fine as well."
17.7.E.1.jpg;  The silver-haired man slams a deck of cards on the table, his one eye narrowed. "Then let's ban the use of skills. Or else you guys have too much of an advantage. If you're caught using a skill, then you're automatically out."
17.7.F.jpg;  Clutching his deck of cards, the armored man grins. "Well, our guild is too poor to fight in a bid war so I'm in." 
17.7.G.jpg;  The purple-haired woman sighs, leaning back with exhaustion. "Alright." she concedes, "we accept your conditions."
17.7.H.jpg; "Huh...?" the dark-haired man mumbles, staring at his cards in disbelief as a voice booms behind him, "Yo, Sword Emperor! You really don't want to call me 'gong-ja-nim,' right?"
17.8.A.jpg; The red-haired man's jaw drops. "I'll allow you to stop after this game is over."  He stammers, "Really?? I can do that??"
17.8.B.0.jpg; The blonde woman, back still turned, states her terms. "In exchange, I want you to tell me what cards everyone has."
18.8.B.1.jpg;  The blonde woman throws down her cards with a smirk. "I know a good fucking deal when I see one, good sir!" 
17.8.C.0.jpg;  Beaming, the red-haired man gives two enthusiastic thumbs up. "Wow, you are as gracious as the ocean. I'll tell you every card they have!" 
17.8.C.1.jpg;  The dark-haired man beams, glancing towards the heavens.  "Gong-ja-nim is so merciful and kind!"
18.1.A.jpg; The red-haired man leans over the dark-haired woman's shoulder, a smug grin on his face. "Sir, this guy has a straight. Fold this round."
18.1.B.jpg;  The dark-haired man meets his opponent's gaze, an unflinching confidence radiating from him as he calmly lays down his ace of hearts.
18.1.C.jpg;  With a dismissive sniff, the red-haired man slings an arm around the scowling, eye-patched man. "This guy's bluffing with just a pair. How pathetic. Call his bluff out!" 
18.1.D.jpg;  With a triumphant grin, the dark-haired man slams down a card, pressing a gold coin into the table. "Call." 
18.1.E.0.jpg; The armored man stares intently at the cards, his expression unreadable. "This guy's aiming for a full house, but don't worry." he assures.
18.1.E.1.jpg;  The red-haired man stabs a finger at the table. "I stuck my face in the table to check the rest of the cards, and he's not gonna get it. Just trust me and we can beat him!" 
18.1.F.jpg;  Eyes closed, the dark-haired man shoves a mountain of gold coins towards the center of the table. "I'm going all in."
18.1.G.0.jpg;  Tension hangs heavy in the air as the players eye each other, cards clutched tightly in their hands. 
18.1.G.1.jpg; The armored man leans forward, his gaze fixed on the table as the players prepare to reveal their hands.
18.1.H.0.jpg;  The grey-haired man explodes from his seat, his face contorted in fury. "What the fuck!! This is a scam!!" 
18.1.H.1.jpg; The armored man recoils in surprise as the brown-haired woman lets out a surprised gasp. 
18.1.I.0.jpg;  The grey-haired man gestures wildly. "There's no way that this is statistically possible. We've played more than 30 rounds and he hasn't lost once.  I can't even bluff. He's 100% cheating!!"
18.1.I.1.jpg;  The grey-haired man jabs an accusing finger at the calmly sipping figure across the table. "You got proof?" 
18.2.A.0;  Two fingers point accusingly as the person in the shadows calmly retorts, "I don't appreciate you pointing fingers at me with no evidence. I could just be a genius poker player."
18.2.A.1; The man in black and red throws his arms wide in mock outrage as a voice cries out, "Holy crap, his audacity! There's no way he's an F-rank!"
18.2.B.0; The grey-haired man claps a hand to his forehead in astonishment.  "Wow!  How did you know I wasn't an F-rank?" he sputters. "I couldn't notify the association, but I just ranked up to E yesterday."
18.2.B.1; "That's right! I knew I-" the grey-haired man starts to crow, before his words die in his throat. "Huh?!"
18.2.C.jpg; "Thanks for the high praise." the grey-haired man sneers, sauntering past the purple-haired woman and her companion.  "By the way." he adds nonchalantly, "it looks like you're out of chips."  "Ugh..." the man in blue groans.
18.2.D.jpg; "Welcome, Chun-moon Master!" the grey-haired man calls out, a triumphant glint in his eye. "I thought it was about time that you lost."  The blond man in the black suit gapes at him in astonishment.
18.2.E.0; "So I ordered you an extra espresso!" chirps a voice, as a hand sets down a steaming cup.  "Drink to your heart's content!"  The grey-haired man scowls. "I told you I don't want to drink!!!" 
18.2.E.1; "I know! You have to overcome your desires!" the other man replies serenely, unfazed by the furious glare directed at him.
18.2.F.jpg; A hush falls over the table as the three players exchange a tense look.
18.2.G.jpg; The armored man stares at his cards in disbelief.  "I lost." he mutters, shaking his head. "I was pretty confident in my poker face. Can you read minds or something?" 
18.3.A.jpg; The man in the blue shirt smiled, entirely relaxed, as the armored woman beside him watched him. "Youngsters these days are hard to deal with." 
18.3.B.jpg; "Yo!!! Why did you give up so easily you loser!!!"  A grey-haired man in a black shirt bellowed, shaking his fist angrily as he stormed across the cafe, nearly knocking over a passing waitress. 
18.3.C.jpg; "You should have tried till the very end!! Are you just gonna let that scammer cheat you?!" His face, twisted in a grimace of rage, was even more severe with a black eye patch.
18.3.D.0.jpg; "Don't call our new hero a scammer." the grey-haired man growled, annoyance flashing across his face, even as the armored woman beside him looked down in disapproval.
18.3.D.1.jpg; "He's using a skill, I guarantee it!" The man in the black shirt confidently declared, even though only his arm could be seen. 
18.3.E.jpg; The woman in white armor smirked, a knowing glint in her eye. "We all knew from the beginning..." she began, her words dripping with smugness.  "What?" 
18.3.F.0.jpg;  "It would be weirder to not know." chuckled a voice from above, amusement lacing the words. "Did you really think a newbie would challenge us to a game of luck? I'm distributing the cards."
18.3.F.1.jpg; Unfazed, the man in the blue shirt calmly watched the woman with long black hair gracefully move around the table, casually dealing out cards to the purple-haired woman seated across from her. 
18.3.G.jpg;  "He basically said I am confident enough to win without revealing my skills! And we accepted that challenge." the man in blue declared, a playful smirk on his face as he held up his cards. 
18.3.H.jpg; "...Chun-moon master... I know you like exercising, but you should use your head too." a voice sighed from behind the shocked, gaping face of the grey-haired man. 
18.4.A.0.jpg; "We never had anything to lose in this game. Winning would have been great, but we have a pretty good deal even if we don't." the man in the navy blue shirt mused, calmly regarding his cards. 
18.4.A.1.jpg; "B-but we have our pride!!! How can we just let a newbie be on the same level as us?!" a voice cried out, a trembling hand clutching a single card. 
18.4.B.jpg; "Pride won't get us through the Tower." the armored man stated resolutely, a determined smile on his face.
18.4.C.0.jpg; "Drink your espresso! You forgot to finish!" a woman with blonde hair chided gently, placing a hand on the shoulder of the stunned, blue-haired man beside her. 
18.4.C.1.jpg;  "Fuuuckk!!"  the blue-haired man swore, staring in horror at the cup of blood in his hand as the blonde woman gasped beside him. 
18.4.D.jpg; "I'm glad." the man with the black earring said plainly, a flicker of annoyance crossing his face as he examined his cards. "About what?" a curious voice inquired from below. 
18.4.E.jpg;  "That you're a sensible person, at least." the purple-haired woman grumbled, shooting a frustrated glare across the table despite the mountain of gold coins before her. 
18.4.F.jpg;  "I'm originally from Ukraine. To be exact, I'm from a place that used to be called Ukraine." the owner of the hand calmly explained as they idly pushed a pile of coins across the table. 
18.4.G.0.jpg; The scene shifted abruptly to a landscape of rubble and ruin.  "After I lost my family to the civil war, I became a drifter." the purple-haired woman said solemnly. 
18.4.G.1.jpg; Nearby, the blonde woman stood atop a pile of debris, her expression wistful. "Living alone sucks whether you're in or outside the Tower." she sighed sadly, watching as a lone figure in the distance walked away. 
17.8.B.1.jpg; The blonde woman smirked at her opponent across the table, "i know a good fucking deal when i see one, good sir!". 
18.2.A.0.jpg;  The woman pointed two fingers, small sparkles emitting from them, "i don't appreciate you pointing fingers at me with no evidence. i could just be a genius poker player."
18.2.A.1.jpg; Shocked, the man in the robe throws his hands up, fingers outstretched, "holy crap. his audacity! there's no way he's an f-rank!"
18.2.B.0.jpg;  The man in the red sash brought his hand to his forehead in surprise, "wow! how did you know i wasn't an f-rank? i couldn't notify the association, but i just ranked up to e yesterday."
18.2.B.1.jpg; The man's eyebrows shot up in surprise, "that's right! i knew i-" he started, but was cut off, "huh?!"
18.2.E.0.jpg; The man with gray hair glared at the man in the green cap, "i told you i don't want to drink!!!", but the other man replied calmly, "so i ordered you an extra espresso! drink to your heart's content!"
18.2.E.1.jpg;  The man's face twisted in anger as a steaming cup of tea was placed in front of him.  "i know! you have to overcome your desires!" the man in the green cap said pleasantly. 
18.4.H.0.jpg; The man looked to the side, a concerned expression on his face as he flipped a gold coin, "call." 
18.4.H.1.jpg;  The woman with brown hair crossed her arms over her chest and stared intensely at the purple-haired woman before her, "so what are you trying to say?"
18.5.A.jpg; The man stared intently at his cards, thinking to himself, "everyone who's come to the tower, especially the first generation, has a sob story. i'm also just a normal orphan in the tower." 
18.5.B.0.jpg; The red-haired man froze, eyes widening in shock as he gestured to the cards, "she has a diamond flush right now." 
18.5.B.1.jpg;  The purple-haired woman gazed steadily at the red-haired man across the table, "this tower is basically my home town."
18.5.C.0.jpg;  The blonde woman smiled confidently as she sipped from her cup, "in this tower, no one asks where you're from. and we've made that happen." 
18.5.C.1.jpg;  The gray-haired man stroked his chin thoughtfully, "whether you're from korea, i'm from ukraine, or the celestial martial master is from china.."
18.5.D.jpg;  The purple-haired woman didn't look up from her cards, "none of that is important in the tower." 
18.5.E.0.jpg;  The brown-haired woman looked down at her cards, a thoughtful expression on her face,  "we can even understand each other due to the tower's blessing. we're all equal challengers in here... it's at least fairer than the outside world."
18.5.E.1.jpg;  The brown-haired woman stood confidently behind her cards and gold coins, her expression serious. 
18.5.F.0.jpg;  The hand slammed down on the stack of coins, sending one flying into the air, "people out there treat the tower like a garbage can."
18.5.F.1.jpg; The purple-haired woman scowled, "it's called garbage can, not garbage cannot."
18.5.G.0.jpg; The sun was setting, casting an orange glow across the room as the clock ticked past 18:09. 
18.5.G.1.jpg;  The city lights twinkled outside the window, a reminder of the life that awaited, "when the clock hits 0, the media will not stop talking about you. your life will completely change."
18.6.A.0.jpg;  The purple-haired woman fixed her gaze on the man in front of her, "i trust that you will deal with it wisely."
18.6.A.1.jpg; The man glanced at the mountain of coins beside the purple-haired woman before nodding curtly, "sounds good to me." 
18.6.B.jpg;  The purple-haired woman leaned back in her chair, a smug look on her face,  "i'm not bragging, but i like being the center of attention. i want everyone to look up to me and respect me. that's all."  The man seated across from her chuckled, "you're pretty honest. the opposite of the sword saint." 
18.6.C.jpg;   The hand deftly bent the gold coin between two fingers,  "she still has a flush. it's disadvantageous for me right now, but.."
18.6.D.jpg;   The purple-haired woman pushed a stack of coins forward. "all-in."
18.6.E.jpg;  The man grinned, leaning back on his pile of coins as if it were a throne, "i'm confident."
18.6.F.0.jpg;  Frustration simmered within him, "let's make another thing clear. i don't expect to be treated like this just because i cleared floor 10."
18.6.F.1.jpg;  His gaze was resolute as he stared at the towering stack of coins, "i will be the one clearing floor 20, 30, 50 and even 100. no matter how long it takes, i will conquer this tower."
18.6.G.0.jpg;  The air crackled with tension as the man addressed the group, "i respect that you hold this tower close to your heart. i don't have any intentions to fight with you guys. who will be the first to scale the tower. who is worthy of being called a hero. but i will consider you my competition." 
18.6.G.1.jpg;  The man gestured towards the mountain of coins with a confident smirk, "my goal isn't to see the world inside the tower but the world beyond it. honestly, i have no idea about the famine or refugee problems here. feel free to use my name whenever you'd like to solve those problems. however, i want your support in climbing this tower. i need to experience that feeling of supremacy again."
18.7.A.jpg;  The purple-haired woman's eyes widened as she took in the sight beyond the cafe windows, her brow furrowed in concern. 
18.7.B.jpg;  The purple-haired woman slumped in her chair, a deep sigh escaping her lips as she stared dejectedly at her cards, "sigh..."
18.7.C.jpg;   Disappointment filled her voice, "i was wrong. you're exactly like the sword saint."
18.7.D.jpg;   The card flipped over, revealing the red 5, "is that a compliment?"
18.7.E.0.jpg;  The hand hovered over the table, "nope. i'm just calling out your greed. black dragon master, flush. kim gong-ja, full house."
18.7.E.1.jpg;   The hand scooped up a pile of gold coins, the diamond flush glinting under the lights, "it's kim gong-ja's win."
18.7.F.jpg;  A genuine smile spread across the man's face, "thank you."
18.7.G.jpg;  The woman fixed him with a serious look, "can we also expect you to uphold an equal amount of responsibility?"
18.7.H.jpg;  The man took a sip from his mug, his expression calm, "isn't a hunter's responsibility to climb the tower? don't worry about that." 
18.7.I.jpg; The purple-haired woman leaned back, a smug smile playing on her lips, "you talk big for a newbie. yeah!!! if shamelessness were a skill, he'd probably hit s-rank with it!"
18.8.A.0.jpg; The three red-haired men roared with laughter, "phew! oh my god, i can breathe again. fuck calling you -nim! zombie zombie! you damn zombie! wow, i'd never realized how beautiful that word was!"
18.8.A.1.jpg; The black-haired man looked up at them, disappointment etched on his face, "is this really the person called the sword emperor...? pathetic... are you leaving already?"
18.8.B.0.jpg;  He turned towards the purple-haired woman, "yeah, floor 11 is opening soon. i have to get ready if i don't want to fall behind."
18.8.C.0.jpg; A single word hung in the air, "it's role play. that's the theme for floors 11-20."
18.8.C.1.jpg;  The purple-haired woman scowled, her arms crossed tightly across her chest.
18.8.D.jpg; The man with short brown hair leaned in conspiratorially, "i got an extra hint for clearing floor 10. that's the extent of my knowledge."
18.8.E.jpg;  The purple-haired woman sighed, shaking her head in annoyance.
18.8.F.0.jpg;  The sun began to set, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink, "we'll make sure to return this favour later."
18.8.F.1.jpg;  The two men walked away, their figures silhouetted against the warm glow of the setting sun. 
19.1.A.0.jpg;  A man and a woman stand on a rooftop, gazing out at the city. "Has the official statement regarding floor 10 been released yet? Did you see the video of the Sword Saint saying it wasn't him?" the woman asks, frustration tinging her voice. 
19.1.A.1.jpg;  Inside a bar, the man angrily slams his beer down. "So angry when he said it. The media isn't giving us any information either" he complains to his friends.
19.1.B.0.jpg;  "Someone did see all the guild leaders in one place yesterday, though." a man with short brown hair comments, curious about the implications. "So who's the one who cleared it?"
19.1.B.1.jpg;  A young man with a brown backpack walks confidently down a busy street, a slight smile on his face.
19.1.C.0.jpg;  "Look!" a voice calls out urgently, drawing attention to the sky where the time reads 00:00:11. 
19.1.C.1.jpg;   A group of people stand eagerly, their eyes glued to the sky. "Just 11 seconds left!" someone shouts excitedly.
19.1.D.jpg;  A bright yellow "10" appears on a light blue background as everyone erupts. "10!!!"
19.1.E.jpg;  A woman with purple hair cheers, a glass raised high, beside her a blonde man pumps his fist in the air. "9!!! 8!!" In the background, a man with black hair watches with an intense frown. 
19.1.F.0.jpg;  All eyes suddenly turn towards a man with black hair, standing in the middle of the bar. "7!! 6!!" someone shouts, pointing, as whispers break out around him.
19.1.F.1.jpg;  The man calmly checks his phone, a hint of amusement playing on his lips. "5!!"
19.2.A.jpg;  "4!!" The man chuckles, glancing at his phone as he scrolls past search results for "Floor 10 clear" on Boogle. 
19.2.B.0.jpg;  "3!!" He quickly navigates to the news section, the screen still dominated by articles about the mysterious clearing.
19.2.B.1.jpg; "2!!" His eyes widen as he sees a hand-drawn image on an article titled "[Urgent] 10th floor was cleared." revealing the clearer's name: Kim Gon.
19.2.C.jpg; "1!!!!!"  His friends erupt in cheers around him as he shows them the news, a broad smile spreading across his face. 
19.2.D.0.jpg;  Suddenly, a blinding light shoots out from a brilliant white "Z" in the sky.
19.2.D.1.jpg;  Everyone stops, staring upwards in awe as beams of white light cascade down, illuminating the cheering crowd below.
19.2.E.jpg;   "The tutorial has been cleared as of today." a voice booms through the air as the man with the black jacket smiles, illuminated by the fading light. 
19.2.F.0.jpg;  The light intensifies once more. "The tutorial has been cleared as of today. We are alerting all Hunters again." 
19.2.F.1.jpg;  The light explodes, revealing a message that echoes across the sky: "Open floor 11! Floor 11!"
19.2.G.0.jpg;  A beautiful woman with blonde hair materializes amidst the blinding light, her arms outstretched in welcome. "Warriors, the ones who choose to climb the Tower." 
19.2.G.1.jpg;  The woman's white dress flows around her as she floats above the cityscape. "I congratulate you on clearing the Hellfire Mansion."
19.3.A.jpg;   Eyes widen as the image of a beautiful woman in white appears on the screen. "An angel" someone whispers, awestruck. "A goddess?" 
19.3.B.jpg;  The woman in white smiles gently, her eyes twinkling. "Of course not. That ain't a goddess."  A collective gasp fills the air. "?"
19.3.C.0.jpg;  "That's just part of the system that explains the quests to you." The woman gestures to the city below. "Like an NPC?"
19.3.C.1.jpg;  Her expression turns serious. "Warriors, there is a world that is in dire need of your assistance. This world is suffering under the Demon King." 
19.3.D.0.jpg;  The crowd watches in stunned silence.  "You will now be summoned there and save humanity from extinction." One man breaks the silence. "How do you even know that?" 
19.3.D.1.jpg;  A man with fiery red hair looks towards the source of the question, surprise etched on his face. "Oh, that?"
19.3.E.jpg;  A single red shoe rests on a wooden surface. "If you choose to accept this destiny, say 'transfer'..." 
19.3.F.jpg;  The man with the brown backpack watches in disbelief as a figure soars through the sky above.
19.3.G.0.jpg;  High above, a man in a black suit stares down at the world below, determination hardening his gaze. 
19.3.G.1.jpg;  The man in the black suit blurs as he moves with impossible speed. 
19.4.A.jpg;  "...choose to accept" The blonde woman in white smiles serenely, hope radiating from her form.
19.4.B.jpg;  "...destiny, say 'transfer'."  Her lips curl into a sly smirk, confidence exuding from her.
19.4.C.0.jpg;  She glances up at the man in the black suit standing on the rooftop as she rises into the air. 
19.4.C.1.jpg;  "Boo... it was just a hologram?" A woman in a red hat throws her hands up in disappointment, drawing the attention of others around her.  
19.4.D.jpg;  High above, the man in the black suit watches, a glowing red circle pulsing around him. 
19.4.E.jpg;  "Because I did that exact thing before." a young man with black hair exclaims, a hint of bewilderment in his red eyes. "What did I tell ya? It's an NPC."
19.4.F.jpg;  The sun shines brightly against a clear blue sky, illuminating the white cross atop a tall building. 
19.4.G.jpg;  "Hahaha!"  A man with brown skin and a purple jacket bursts out laughing, drawing shocked stares from those around him. 
19.4.H.jpg;  A man with slicked-back blonde hair storms forward, pointing accusingly. "I lost first place again! What a great day! Heresy Inquisitor!" 
19.4.I.jpg;   "I hope to see everyone on floor 11! Transfer!"  The man in the black suit beams, his excitement contagious.
19.4.J.0.jpg;  "T-Transfer." stammers a man, fear flashing across his face as another man in a blue jacket jabs a finger in his direction.  "Warriors, the ones who choose to climb the tower."
19.4.J.1.jpg;  "Transfer!" The man shouts, staring up at the woman in white as she hovers above the city. "Transfer!"  "From the eleventh to the twentieth floor, your faith will be tested."
19.5.A.jpg;   "...and during that, you will find an answer." the woman continues. "And the answer you find will serve as a reminder of who you really are."
19.5.B.jpg;  A young man with kind eyes absorbs her words, a flicker of curiosity crossing his face. "This is how you are destined to learn about yourself..."
19.5.C.0.jpg;  "That's too bad." a woman sighs, her shoulders slumping in disappointment as she watches a man in a black jacket walk away.
19.5.C.1.jpg;  "What's too bad?" The man spins around, his brow furrowed in concern. "Think about it."
19.5.D.0.jpg;  The blonde woman stands alone in the deserted city, her expression wistful.  "I'm not sure what existence created this tower, but it seems like a lot of effort went into it. That's a message that the creators left us. But no one cares about it."
19.5.D.1.jpg;  She gazes up at the towering structures, a hint of awe in her eyes. "Ordinarily, we should be looking at this full of admiration. The existence of the tower, skills... they're all miracles in their own right."
19.5.E.jpg;  "But we've already grown accustomed to everything by floor 10."  A man in armor observes the man beside him. "You're more emotional than I thought." 
19.5.F.jpg; The armored man boasts, "i used to study music before i came in here. why? am i more charming now that you know how artistic i am?"  A nearby caption clarifies, "t/n: she is a girl." to which someone else comments, "o.g/n: definitely wouldn't have known otherwise."
19.5.G.jpg; The black-haired man laughs loudly, "haha, that hurts, man! yo zombie."  His friend with red hair stares at him, unimpressed, as someone remarks, "it sounds like a hard major to find a job with."
19.5.H.jpg; Startled, the man with the brown bag glances over his shoulder and stammers, "ah, why-" as a voice warns, "be careful. this human is a little suspicious."
19.6.A.0.jpg; The man with black hair blinks in surprise. "are you mr. gong-ja?" someone asks. "whoops, you must have caught their attention because of me." he murmurs anxiously. 
19.6.A.1.jpg; "Silly me. well, i'm heading to floor 11 now!" the armored man announces cheerfully, striding through the city with the black-haired man at his side as onlookers stare.
19.6.B.0.jpg; "Mr. gong-ja!!" the man in the black jacket cries out desperately, his face a mask of fear.
19.6.B.1.jpg; The man with dark hair clenches his jaw, his expression strained as he faces the throng of reporters.  "is this why you came to talk to me?!" he demands. 
19.6.C.jpg; The man in the blue and white suit smiles warmly, extending his hand. "Well, i have an eye for gauging sincerity, so i just wanted to see what kind of person you were." 
19.6.D.0.jpg; The dark-haired man stands frozen, his back to the viewer, as the confident man in the blue suit gestures to the city behind them. "The answer is in your heart! transfer!" he declares.
19.6.D.1.jpg; "You're just going to run away?!?" the brown-haired man roars, his face contorted with rage, while the red-haired man points at him worriedly.  "I told you she was suspicious!" 
19.6.E.0.jpg;  The man with short brown hair shifts uncomfortably as a reporter shoves a microphone towards him. "We're from Hwan-Moon News! Can you please answer our questions?!" the reporter presses, "Is it true that you cleared floor 10 by yourself?!"
19.6.E.1.jpg; Microphones and cameras swarm the brown-haired man, blinding him with flashes.  "Everyone is wondering which guild you're planning to join!!" a voice calls out from the throng.
19.6.F.jpg;  The dark-haired man chews his lip anxiously, trapped in a whirlwind of questions.  "I have to go to floor 11 now... what should I say?" he wonders, while voices bombard him with inquiries: "What relationship do you have with the paladin?!" and "Are you really an e-rank?!"
19.7.A.jpg;  The man forces a smile, anxiety churning in his gut as the reporters close in. "Floor 20 will also be cleared by me." he states. 
19.7.B.0.jpg; "Well, work hard, everyone, transfer!" the dark-haired man calls out, a sudden urgency in his voice. "Huh? Wait, no! Mr. Gong-ja!!!" a voice cries from below. 
19.7.B.1.jpg; Bathed in a radiant light, the woman in the white dress ascends gracefully into the clouds. "[All those who wish to climb the tower.]." a voice echoes from the heavens.
19.7.C.0.jpg; A simple message appears against the swirling black and white void: "I wish you the best."
19.7.C.1.jpg; A blinding white beam cleaves through the air, leaving behind a trail of defeated figures and a resounding chorus of "of of of of."
19.7.D.jpg; The older man in the blue suit glares out from the image, his expression thunderous with anger.
19.7.E.0.jpg; A desperate plea rings out against a backdrop of chaos and swirling grey: "Where are-"  "Don't let them push!!!" "Stop the demon army!!!!!!" 
19.7.E.1.jpg; The older man in the blue suit stands resolutely on the dirt path, sword drawn, with the man in pink and the girl in the red jacket behind him. "For the kingdom of..." the inscription begins.
20.1.B.0.jpg; The man in green armor rallies his troops, his words laced with desperation. "Don't fall back! Our empire is done for if we lose any more ground!" 
20.1.B.1.jpg; Fear grips the soldiers as they face the imposing green monster. "It doesn't seem to be possible, sir!" one shouts, "There are too many enemies, sir!" 
20.1.C.0.jpg; The older man in the blue suit marches forward, his face grim. "What the hell are these monsters?!" he mutters under his breath.
20.1.C.1.jpg; "What's going on?!" the man in the blue jacket asks, casting a worried glance over his shoulder as he runs. "Don't give up! We are the last line of defense!" a voice calls out from behind.
20.1.D.0.jpg;  "Watch out for the arrows!!" the gray-haired man shouts, his eyes wide with alarm.
20.1.D.1.jpg;  The muscular man in the black tank top yells in shock, stumbling back as if struck. 
20.1.E.0.jpg;  Confusion reigns as fragmented phrases hang in the air. "What's going on?" "The tutorial's over, that's what."  "Situations like these become common in future stages."  "Ohhhh!" 
20.1.E.1.jpg;  The brown-haired man in the black jacket looks up with anticipation, the man in the light blue jacket peering over his shoulder, as the armored figure salutes towards the sky.  "Heroes who will save our kingdom!" the caption declares.
20.1.F.0.jpg;  The armored man stands tall, his gaze unwavering as he holds his sword aloft. "Please assist us in our quest to defend humanity!" he implores. 
20.1.F.1.jpg; The white-haired man in silver armor stands poised for battle, his sword gleaming in the sunlight. 
20.1.G.0.jpg; Fear etches itself onto the faces of the two men. "This port is the only place with an open trade route." one says. "Without this port, our kingdom will not be able to sustain itself!"
20.1.G.1.jpg;  "Hey, people in the front! Shut up! We can't hear from the back!" someone yells from the distance.  The black-haired man, his eyes glowing red, ignores the outburst. "You've gotten ridiculously good at strengthening your sight and hearing with aura." a voice notes from beside him. 
20.2.A.0.jpg;  A message flashes across a bright blue screen: "Heroes from another world! Bestow your blessings upon Aegim! Quest name: [Defend the Port]. Difficulty: F-A. Goal: Disaster has fallen upon the Empire of Aegim. The legendary Demon King has gathered his army to overthrow the empire. The Demon King is cunning, ruthless, and strong. He wants to cut off the supplies to the city. Protect the port!"
20.2.A.1.jpg; The armored man grips his sword, his gaze resolute. "This is the first step in saving the empire. *Floor 12 will not open if the battle is lost." the warning hangs in the air.
20.2.B.0.jpg; "A quest!?" the blonde woman gasps, her hand flying to her mouth in astonishment. "There's a Demon King?!" the white-haired man exclaims, his eyes wide with disbelief.
20.2.B.1.jpg;  "Where the hell is this Aegim Empire?!" the blonde woman shouts, her frustration mounting as she and the gray-haired man battle their unseen opponents.
20.2.C.0.jpg; The person with blue hair struggles to keep up with the onslaught.  "They're coming at us nonstop!  Let me read the quest at least!" they plead, their voice frantic.
20.2.C.1.jpg;  The fighter in the blue pants parries a blow from a green monster, their face creased with worry. "How are we supposed to clear the quest anyway?!" they mutter under their breath.
20.2.D.0.jpg;  The white-haired man slices through a green monster with a decisive swing of his sword. "I don't know the details." he says, his expression grim, "But I think I just have to kill them all." 
20.2.D.1.jpg;  The white-haired man, his sword flashing, cuts a swathe through the enemy ranks. "Follow the Sword Saint!" a cry rises from the watching crowd. 
20.2.E.0.jpg;  "Shitty ass goblins!" the man in the black tank top scoffs, his companions flanking him with equally disdainful expressions. "I've killed thousands of goblins in the last 6 years!"
20.2.E.1.jpg;  The woman with long brown hair channels her magic, amplifying the power of the spear in the black-haired man's hands as they face their opponents with unwavering focus. 
20.2.F.0.jpg;  "Destroy them!!" a voice booms.  The black-haired man in the white shirt nods curtly, his expression grim. "Calm down, and push them away after you kill them!" another voice advises.
20.2.F.1.jpg;  The black-haired man stands over the slain creature, his sword dripping, a confident smirk playing on his lips. "[Welcome, Kim Gong-ja.]." a message appears, as if heralding his arrival. 
20.3.A.0.jpg;  The red-haired man throws his head back and lets out a triumphant shout, his grin infectious as he celebrates with his brown-haired companion.
20.3.A.1.jpg; The man in the black jacket stands calmly as a blue holographic display materializes before him, the words "Receiving floor 10 rewards" shimmering in the air.
20.3.B.0.jpg;  "Normal stage reward." the brown-haired man reads aloud, his eyes widening in disbelief as he stares at the map.
20.3.B.1.jpg;  Excitement washes over the brown-haired man as two new messages pop up on his display: "You are blessed by the Goddess of War!" and "You have access to the maps of floors 11 to 20."
20.3.C.0.jpg;  "Hidden stage reward." the blue text proclaims.  "You should focus on training lying on these like skills!" a voice advises, tinged with amusement. "What the fuck! I knew it was going to be something crazy!" another voice exclaims, a mixture of disbelief and excitement in their tone. 
20.3.C.1.jpg;  The man with brown hair throws his right arm in the air, shocked as a blue box reading "you are blessed by the goddess of humanity!" appears before him. "What?" the red-haired man beside him yells, throwing his arms out in anger.  
20.3.D.jpg;  "you have access to npc locations of floors 11 to 20.." the blue glowing text box declares, buzzing with the thrill of unexplored territory.
20.3.E.0.jpg;  Above a card depicting a sword, a blue text box glows, "hidden stage reward." "What?!?" the green-haired man holding the card gasps, his eyes wide with surprise.
20.3.E.1.jpg;  Smiling, the green-haired man holds up a card with an axe on it as the blue text box in front of him announces, "you are blessed by the goddess of merchants!"  The red-haired man beside him stares in shock at the two cards. 
20.3.F.jpg;  "you can obtain one item that exists on floors 11 to 20 right now.." the blue text box proclaims, radiating a sense of thrilling possibility. 
20.3.G.0.jpg; "ah..." the brown-haired man breathes, gazing upwards with a delighted smile at the large, red glowing map displayed before him in the dark room. 
20.3.G.1.jpg;  "this is what real talent is..." the man in the black jacket murmurs in awe, gesturing excitedly with one hand raised towards the smaller, red-haired figure below. "fuck this rng!" the smaller man in the white robe cries, his mouth open in a wail. 
20.4.A.0.jpg;  Three boxes bordered in black appear against the backdrop of a majestic, stylized cityscape reflected in water. "themes." the top box states simply. "each section of the tower has a theme." the middle box elaborates.  "the theme for floors 1 to 10 is [tutorial]." the bottom box reveals. "it's a city made" someone comments from below. 
20.4.A.1.jpg;  The imposing, red tower dominates the image, jagged streaks of white lightning flashing across its dark surface. "and the theme for floors 11 to 20 is [demon king and heroes]." a box in the corner declares.  "for beginners to get used to the tower, and the floors have designated hunting areas." it adds above.
20.4.B.0.jpg;  The older man charges forward, blue suit jacket billowing behind him as he brandishes his sword with a fierce snarl.  "you need enough might to be able to destroy armies" hovers above him. 
20.4.B.1.jpg;  Muscles taut with focus, the man in the blue suit blasts the two green creatures with a wave of white energy. 
20.4.C.0.jpg; "or lead an army into battle yourself." the caption proclaims as the young man with the brown hair and black jacket surveys the assembled soldiers with a confident smirk.
20.4.C.1.jpg; The ground trembles slightly under the weight of the armored soldiers, their formation unwavering in its disciplined might. 
20.4.D.jpg; "and you're going to pick the latter?" the red-haired man demands, his face a mask of outrage. "do you have any experience with that? have you led anything before?" 
20.4.E.jpg; "of course not." the young man with brown hair replies easily, his palm raised as if weighing the question. A ball of energy crackles to life above it.
20.4.F.jpg; "but i'm confident that i can learn."  A hand taps decisively at the second skill on the list glowing on the yellow and orange grid:  "2. returner's winding clock ex". Above it, the other entries read "class: e-rank", "skills 5/5", "1. i want to become just like you s+",  "3. sword throne a+",  "4. going high society f", and "5. you can prevent fire a".  
20.5.A.jpg; "hey sword emperor, you complained about my rng before, right?"  the man with black hair asks calmly, his arms crossed as the muscular man with red hair behind him throws his hands up in frustration. "yeah! it's complete shit!" 
20.5.B.0.jpg;  "i'll show you why this game is all skill and no luck." the caption declares above a list detailing "[enju] position: scout / location: floor 11, port city kunkur [karia] position: foot soldier / location: floor 11, port city kunkur [sorrt] position: farmer / location: floor 13, baron's field [lapa casabella] position: government official / location: floor 14 building [doph] position: blacksmith / location: floor 12, empire capital hakarvnia".
20.5.B.1.jpg;  Turning towards his goal, the man with brown hair raises his right arm in greeting. "[locating npcs]" a blue box flashes at the bottom of the bright space. 
20.5.C.jpg;   "only display the ones on floor 11." The command echoes in the futuristic space as the man with black hair gestures sharply with his right hand, activating the yellow rectangles glowing behind him. 
20.5.D.jpg; "only display from the top 100 npcs with high-level skills." the command prompts. "[enju] position: scout / location: floor 11, port city kunkur" flashes in a yellow box, followed by "[karia] position: foot soldier / location: floor 11, port city kunkur". 
20.5.E.0.jpg;  "wait, no! zombie! this isn't it! let's just fight them one at a time and get stronger!" one voice cries out in dismay.  "wow, i know you're shameless, but this really isn't it! aren't you embarrassed to call yourself gong-ja?!" another voice adds, disgusted.
20.5.E.1.jpg;  "not at all." the muscular man with red hair states flatly, his hand outstretched towards the shrinking form of the man with black hair. "only show the npcs with leadership skills!" 
20.5.F.0.jpg; "just the top 3!"  Two more yellow boxes appear: "[rohan pansaba] position: pansaba knightage leader" and  "[sarbast aegim] position: kunkur offense leader".
20.5.F.1.jpg; "put them on the map." the man with black hair orders, his arm outstretched towards the glowing yellow box as if pulling the information from it. 
20.5.G.0.jpg;   On the pink and white map, a single blue spot pulses. "and my location as well!"  
20.5.G.1.jpg;  "if the other hunters get to it first, our profits would dwindle." the man with short brown hair explains, jabbing a finger at the two blue orbs hovering above the mountain range on the map. 
20.6.A.0.jpg;  "isn't this a game of pure skill?"  The man with short brown hair smirks confidently at the map of the mountain range, his smugness radiating off him. 
20.6.A.1.jpg;  Arms crossed, the man in the black jacket stands beneath the single blue orb, utterly self-satisfied. "i've turned my already-good rewards to extremely good rewards." he boasts. "all because i'm so skilled." 
20.6.B.jpg;  "you call that skill? you're just a hack!!"  The accusation rings out as the man with short brown hair walks confidently past a furious, red-haired man,  pointing at the blue orb displayed on the map. "that's part of my skill, too." he throws over his shoulder with a smirk. 
20.6.C.jpg;  "the closet blue dot on this map..." the armored man rumbles, hefting his sword as he eyes a small, green creature cowering nearby.
20.6.D.0.jpg;  "is this npc!" the man with short brown hair blurts, staring in shock at the imposing, sword-wielding figure before him. 
20.6.D.1.jpg;  "hello, general aegim." the man in the black jacket dips his head respectfully as he addresses the stoic knight standing beside him in the forest clearing. 
20.6.E.0.jpg;  "ooh!" the armored man exclaims, turning in surprise.  "how can i help you, hero from another world?" 
20.6.E.1.jpg;  "You have a magnificent mustache." the man with short brown hair observes, meeting the armored man's gaze with an amused grin. 
20.6.F.0.jpg;  "this hero has a request for you, general." a voice calls out as the man with short brown hair throws a worried look over his shoulder.  "don't believe" 
20.6.F.1.jpg;   "him, you stupid npc. he's a liar!" the red-haired man in the white robe bellows, shaking his fist as the man with short brown hair walks determinedly away. 
20.6.G.jpg;  "as long as it's within my limits, i will do everything in my pow..." the silver-haired general begins, his gaze steady despite the storm clouds gathering above. 
20.7.A.jpg;  "kill me."  The general jerks his head up, eyes wide with disbelief. "excuse me?" 
20.7.B.0.jpg;  "i have a secret last resort." the brown-haired man insists, facing the general even as another voice cries out in warning. "no he doesn't!" 
20.7.B.1.jpg;  "when my heart stops, the god of war will bless the battle field."  The brown-haired man clutches at his chest, a fervent light in his eyes.
20.7.C.0.jpg;  "it's essentially self-destruction" the caption clarifies. "if we can activate the blessing, we will be able to win."  "a b- blessing..." another voice breathes, a flicker of hope in the face of despair. 
20.7.C.1.jpg;  "but to take your life... i could never!"  The armored general shakes his head, sorrow etched on his face. "general sarbast aegim." 
20.7.D.jpg; "consider what's at stake here." the caption urges.  "if you don't kill me, i plan to take my life right here."  The stakes are raised, a dangerous ultimatum hanging in the air.
20.7.E.0.jpg;  Clutching a green object in his hand, the brown-haired man holds his ground as the red-haired man yells behind him and the armored general glares in disapproval.
20.7.E.1.jpg;  "because i know that this is the best way to help our kingdom."  The red-haired man throws his hand out, his expression earnest. "that's why i'm requesting this from you." "a request...?"
20.7.F.0.jpg;  Eyes squeezed shut, sword held high, the red-haired man steels himself. "i want to leave my life to you, the honorable general who is risking his life to protect the kingdom."
20.7.F.1.jpg;  The red-haired man's eyes fly open in alarm, snapping up towards the sky as the man in the black jacket watches the unfolding scene impassively. 
20.7.G.0.jpg;  "there's no time. hurry!"  But a heavy weight settles over the scene, a sense of terrible, inevitable consequence. "no matter how high the stakes are, to think i have to take the life of a hero from another world..."
20.7.G.1.jpg;  "is he really going to believe this?!" the armored general breathes, staring down in stunned disbelief at the man kneeling before him. 
20.7.H.0.jpg;  The world feels cursed and wretched: "what a cursed, wretched world we live in. the attack of the supposedly-legendary demon king, as well as having to take this hero's life..."
20.7.H.1.jpg; Covering his face, the armored man is in disbelief at the red-haired man's words: "i think what's actually cursed is your intelligence..." 
20.8.A.0.jpg; With a determined expression, the armored man holds his sword, ready to strike: "may you never forgive our sins, lord. I shall make this swift and painless."
20.8.A.1.jpg; Standing confidently before the shining sword, the man expresses his gratitude: "You have my sincerest gratitude."
20.8.B.jpg; The armored man looks down seriously, seeking an answer: "Please tell me your name."
20.8.C.jpg;  He calmly replies, his demeanor peaceful and serene: "Kim Gong-ja."
20.8.D.jpg;  "Kim Gong-ja.. I thank you for your sacrifice."  The man in the gas mask mourns, his head bowed in sadness. 
20.8.E.0.jpg;  Standing powerfully in a large white area, the armored man raises his sword towards an old man.
20.8.E.1.jpg;  The man in black stands proudly, the weight of the words "you are a true hero" settling upon him.
20.8.F.jpg;  The bright blue glow of the message stands out against the stark black background: "[you have died.]" 
20.8.G.jpg;  "There's a saying."  The screen glows, displaying the message: "[randomly copying npc sarbast aegim's skills.]"
20.8.H.0.jpg;  "There's someone who flies above the person who runs." The words hang heavy in the air: "shitty ass goblins! I've killed thousands of goblins in the last 6 years!"
20.8.H.1.jpg; "There's also another saying."  The man charges, sword raised, while the woman summons her power and a green goblin snarls.
20.9.A.jpg;  Shock paints the faces of the three figures against the vibrant background
20.9.B.0.jpg;  "there's a hunter who wields soldiers next to the hunters who wield swords." Three figures on horseback ride across the horizon, their forms radiating power.
20.9.B.1.jpg;  "who is that hunter, and why is he riding with them?!" Confusion ripples through the crowd as they stare at the dark-haired man overlooking them from his position of power. 
20.9.C.0.jpg;  "said by the great gong-ja-nim."  The man smiles confidently, his determination evident. 
20.9.C.1.jpg;  He stands firm, his grip on the gleaming sword unwavering, ready to face any threat.
