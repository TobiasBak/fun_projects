61.0.A.0.jpg; That is a special stone of the ancient times. The man in white moves his pen left and right. A red glow emanates from the man's hand.
61.0.B.0.jpg; What? the woman with pink hair runs behind the man.
61.0.C.0.jpg; The boat has recently landed on the beach. The group of people look at the boat.
61.1.A.0.jpg; Such a strange boat! hehehe... The young woman and the young man look at each other.
61.1.B.0.jpg; But there's something she doesn't understand.
61.1.C.0.jpg; Why don't you just transfer what you've already built instead of transferring the materials? there's a principle when it comes to forging.
61.1.C.1.jpg; Whatever the forged item is depends on the craftsmen's thoughts and his familiarity with the item. Parts of the spaceship are scattered.
61.2.B.0.jpg; If she has a basic sketch on the transferred stone, she can create whatever ship she wants from the sketch.
61.2.C.0.jpg; Oh! so that's what it is. The girl stares at the boy.
61.2.D.0.jpg; So how many types of ships are in here? the man's hand is on the girl's head.
61.2.E.0.jpg; Ahaha, actually... He blushes and sweats.
61.3.A.0.jpg; Prior to the competition, we experimented with a lot of things. The man sits on the floor.
61.3.B.0.jpg; Hey, xiang ye... He reaches out towards the other man. He is nervous.
61.3.C.0.jpg; How can you tell her our techniques, she's one of our opponents! the man with green hair is surprised.
61.3.D.0.jpg; Hey, this is nothing. He waves his hand.
61.3.E.0.jpg; Even if you're not brushing off the opponent, at least consider yi bei's feelings! the young man points forward.
61.4.A.0.jpg; The man looks at the viewer seriously. The woman looks away.
61.4.B.0.jpg; It's not like i want to be close to you. The woman crosses her arms.
61.4.C.0.jpg; Hey, are you really salty about all of this? he smiles smugly.
61.4.D.0.jpg; So your name is xiang ye, that's a unique name!
61.5.A.0.jpg; My name is aisha, please take care of me. She smiles.
61.5.B.0.jpg; Haha, please to meet you aisha. He holds her hand.
61.5.C.0.jpg; Since your boat is so big, do you mind taking my classmates and i with you? she looks right.
61.5.D.0.jpg; Yes please! the man rides the cat quickly.
61.5.E.0.jpg; Forging class is the best class at the academy! he smiles happily.
61.6.A.0.jpg; No, we're supposed to be opponents! the young man is standing with his arms outstretched.
61.6.B.0.jpg; Modo, you're going to die a virgin at this rate.
61.6.C.0.jpg; Don't you guys have flying brooms? actually, aisha wanted to help me, i can't fly nor swim...
61.6.D.0.jpg; So this cat...
61.7.A.0.jpg; What are you doing, little shit?
61.7.B.0.jpg; Ahaha, my bad.
61.7.C.0.jpg; If you agree to take us across the lake.
61.7.D.0.jpg; I'll return the favor to you all.
61.7.E.0.jpg; What are these guys thinking... F-favor...
61.8.A.0.jpg; If we're doing it, then let's do it together. I'm not against the idea.
61.8.B.0.jpg; Doing it?
61.8.C.0.jpg; What i'm trying to say is that i'm not against the idea of crossing the river with opponents! mehehe... Asshole...
61.8.D.0.jpg; If that's the case, then let's depart!
61.8.E.0.jpg; They're like... And it's not even a real eagle.
61.9.A.0.jpg; The dragon of destruction.
61.9.B.0.jpg; The champion.
61.9.C.0.jpg; Why haven't they left yet? what are they talking about?
61.9.E.0.jpg; What did yalu mean a moment ago?
61.9.F.0.jpg; It's stressing me out...
62.0.A.0.jpg; They're pushing off with their sticks to move the sheet of ice.
62.0.B.0.jpg; I didn't think that we'd waste so much time in the first round.
62.0.C.0.jpg; Don't worry, we'll catch up for sure!
62.0.D.0.jpg; Everyone look, what's that thing?
62.0.E.0.jpg; He quickly looks up at the sky.
61.9.D.0.jpg; The champion is sitting on the throne.
62.1.A.0.jpg; Woah!
62.1.B.0.jpg; The sea.
62.1.C.0.jpg; We're going ahead!
62.1.D.0.jpg; It's the forging class! huh?!
62.2.A.0.jpg; What are they operating? who knows. She quickly pulls her hood down to cover her face.
62.2.B.0.jpg; You can't escape. She stands defensively.
62.2.C.0.jpg; The character quickly runs.
62.2.D.0.jpg; I'm sorry but you are all going to die! he quickly looks at the bright light.
62.2.E.0.jpg; Is that what they made? i've never seen a boat that quick before! they quickly look to the right in shock.
62.3.A.0.jpg; The champion is reading a book.
62.3.B.0.jpg; This year's forging class is interesting!
62.3.C.0.jpg; Sophisas! your highness.
62.3.D.0.jpg; She asks him about his relationship with another student.
62.3.E.0.jpg; He considers him a good friend.
62.4.A.0.jpg; He's an intelligent craftsman, he'll become a big asset to the kingdom in the future!
62.4.B.0.jpg; He happily smiles.
62.4.C.0.jpg; The rock quickly moves through the ocean.
62.4.D.0.jpg; He quickly glances around.
62.4.E.0.jpg; He rapidly falls into the water.
62.5.A.0.jpg; Hehehe! he swims quickly.
62.5.B.0.jpg; Huh? they swim quickly.
62.5.C.0.jpg; Wait... They swim in different directions.
62.5.D.0.jpg; Eli, wei liang disappeared! what? he looks surprised.
62.5.E.0.jpg; He stands silently.
62.6.A.0.jpg; He stands silently.
62.6.B.0.jpg; He rapidly falls into the water.
62.6.C.0.jpg; The legs slowly walk on the water.
62.6.D.0.jpg; Is this a joke? he looks surprised.
62.7.A.0.jpg; Wait... They swim quickly.
62.7.B.0.jpg; He rapidly falls into the water. Large tentacles grab him.
62.7.C.0.jpg; The snake squeezes him tightly.
62.7.D.0.jpg; The muscular man pushes the snake away.
62.7.E.0.jpg; He quickly punches the other man.
62.8.A.0.jpg; I will crush you. He glares intensely.
62.8.B.0.jpg; He rapidly falls into the water.
62.8.C.0.jpg; He carries him and falls into the water.
62.8.D.0.jpg; What was that thing? he looks down at the other man.
62.8.E.0.jpg; He flies quickly through the air.
62.9.A.0.jpg; That's the great ancient beast, the sea dragon! he stands in the water.
62.9.B.0.jpg; It's finally here! he smiles happily.
62.9.C.0.jpg; The lake of sound's protector - the void king. He smirks.
63.0.A.0.jpg; [the void king] the lake of sound's protector. It rises from the water slowly.
63.0.B.0.jpg; Brother, let's go around the beast to avoid him! they look at the large creature.
63.0.C.0.jpg; The bird flies upward quickly.
63.0.D.0.jpg; They've already been held off, let's take advantage of this opportunity to pass the first level. They smile smugly.
63.0.E.0.jpg; The large sea creature emerges from the water.
63.1.A.0.jpg; It moves quickly.
63.1.B.0.jpg; He swings his arm forward quickly.
63.1.C.0.jpg; He stands powerfully.
63.1.D.0.jpg; He's not an ordinary person. He is hit hard.
63.1.E.0.jpg; Take care of wei liang. He pushes the other man underwater.
63.2.A.0.jpg; The monster twists in the water.
63.2.B.0.jpg; He swims quickly away from the rock formation.
63.2.C.0.jpg; Arm! he yells loudly.
63.2.D.0.jpg; He is surrounded by a large explosion.
63.2.E.0.jpg; What? he throws a punch quickly.
63.3.A.0.jpg; Fist of wind! he is pulled into the whirlwind.
63.3.B.0.jpg; The fish roars loudly.
63.3.C.0.jpg; You must get out of here! the monster emerges from the water.
63.4.A.0.jpg; Shit, i can't fully take advantage of my abilities in the water! he looks at the water worriedly.
63.4.B.0.jpg; They stand in the water and look up at the sky.
63.4.C.0.jpg; Sky. She stares ahead seriously.
63.4.E.0.jpg; They fly through the air on broomsticks.
63.5.A.0.jpg; The large shadow pushes up from the water.
63.5.B.0.jpg; Wa wa wa! they move quickly through the water.
63.5.C.0.jpg; It seems like we accidentally hurt a few people in the process... They look at each other worriedly.
63.5.D.0.jpg; The past. He summons magic from the circle.
63.5.E.0.jpg; Whirlpool.
63.6.A.0.jpg; I'm not a fish! the fish-like creature emerges from the water.
63.6.B.0.jpg; What? he looks around in panic.
63.6.C.0.jpg; The fish is pulled into the whirlpool.
63.6.D.0.jpg; Do not block the way of the king! he looks serious.
63.7.A.0.jpg; The fish creature is trapped in the tornado.
63.7.B.0.jpg; Wahhh. Retreat! they swim quickly.
63.7.C.0.jpg; The owl flies through the sky.
63.7.D.0.jpg; Huh, what's that? he looks surprised.
63.8.A.0.jpg; Wahhh, what is that thing! the bird flies away from the whirlpool.
63.8.B.0.jpg; The bird flies through the vortex.
63.8.C.0.jpg; He looks at the tornado.
63.8.D.0.jpg; Hmph. He stands silently.
63.9.A.0.jpg; The shoes create blue swirls in the water.
63.9.B.0.jpg; They fly through the sky on brooms.
63.9.C.0.jpg; That's rennes for ya! they stand happily.
64.0.A.0.jpg; Woah! he defeated an a-grade monster with one spell! he looks surprised.
64.0.B.0.jpg; He is a prince after all. So powerful. He stands in the aura.
64.0.C.0.jpg; Sophisas. She looks to the left.
64.0.D.0.jpg; Do you think rennes may be as strong as the regent in the future? they sit on the throne.
64.0.E.0.jpg; Since you asked, i shall answer honestly. He looks serious.
64.1.A.0.jpg; Rennes' abilities as a person are significantly strong, but the regent is a war veteran. The battlefield is not the same as the competing grounds. He looks to the right.
64.1.B.0.jpg; I can't believe he defeated it with a single spell! they sit in surprise.
64.1.C.0.jpg; Ah, my beloved students! where are they now? she looks off to the side sadly.
64.1.D.0.jpg; Let's hope the best for my students too. She looks serious.
64.1.E.0.jpg; He flies through the air.
64.2.A.0.jpg; He swims seriously through the water.
64.2.B.0.jpg; Eli... I'm sorry for dragging you back. Wei liang is at his limits, what do we do now? they swim through the water.
64.2.C.0.jpg; Just trudge through for a little longer! he looks determined.
64.2.D.0.jpg; Eli. He steers the boat.
64.2.E.0.jpg; Thanks. He helps the man put on a cloth.
64.3.A.0.jpg; Xiang ye, you've managed to make something new again! he smiles happily.
64.3.B.0.jpg; Hehe, this is called a speed boat, not bad right! he smiles happily.
64.3.C.0.jpg; Huh? he looks surprised.
64.3.D.0.jpg; Rain? they look up at the sky.
64.3.E.0.jpg; Shit! it's about to come back down. He looks up in shock.
64.4.A.0.jpg; He looks up at the sky in surprise.
64.4.B.0.jpg; Wahhh! a large wave crashes on the boat.
64.4.C.0.jpg; Meowwwww! the cat stands in the boat.
64.5.A.0.jpg; The boat moves away from the splash.
64.5.B.0.jpg; The dragon's mouth emerges from the water.
64.5.C.0.jpg; The creature emerges from the water.
64.6.A.0.jpg; Not good, that's the beast's second form, legends say that if the void beast turns into a red color, it will instantly be raised into the s-grade category! she looks up in shock.
64.6.B.0.jpg; It's all rennes' fault, he angered the beast and took off on his own! let me at him! he clenches his fist angrily.
64.6.C.0.jpg; There's no need for you to take action. She looks worried.
64.6.D.0.jpg; Hmph, an s-grade monster? his eyes widen.
64.6.E.0.jpg; Forging class, listen up! yes! he addresses the class.
64.7.A.0.jpg; Start the device! he smiles determinedly.
64.7.B.0.jpg; He uses the control panel.
64.7.C.0.jpg; A finger presses the green button.
64.7.D.0.jpg; The boat sinks beneath the water.
64.8.A.0.jpg; The ship sinks slowly.
64.8.B.0.jpg; He walks away from the others.
64.8.C.0.jpg; Meow. The cat is startled by the movement.
64.9.A.0.jpg; Crash! the ship crashes into the water.
64.9.B.0.jpg; Crack crack crack! the gun fires.
64.9.C.0.jpg; This is just a game. He looks at the screen.
65.0.A.0.jpg; Why is there shielding on the ship? he looks down curiously.
65.0.B.0.jpg; Xiang ye, are you trying to protect us? he looks to the right.
65.0.C.0.jpg; The ocean's wrath. The creature rises from the ocean.
65.0.D.0.jpg; I want to pull an offensive! he smiles.
65.1.A.0.jpg; The gun rotates from the hole.
65.1.B.0.jpg; A bright yellow beam shoots out of the red and black square.
65.1.C.0.jpg; Large orange explosions erupt quickly in the dark grey sky.
65.1.D.0.jpg; The ship flies rapidly through the air above the water.
65.2.A.0.jpg; Ouch! the red beast roars loudly.
65.2.B.0.jpg; He drives the boat carefully.
65.2.C.0.jpg; Meow—this boat is going to fall apart! the cat yells worriedly.
65.2.D.0.jpg; So powerful! he exclaims in surprise.
65.2.E.0.jpg; This is a revised version of xiang ye's steam-powered gun! the man wearing glasses explains.
65.3.A.0.jpg; It has a fire rate of 3000 rpm! he points excitedly.
65.3.B.0.jpg; You're okay... He says softly.
65.3.C.0.jpg; No wonder he's been sleeping late these past few evenings, has he been messing with things like this? she wonders aloud.
65.3.D.0.jpg; The red monster emerges from the water with a large explosion.
65.3.E.0.jpg; Stop! stop! stop hurting me! the monster cries out in pain.
65.4.A.0.jpg; What the fuck, this thing speaks human! he exclaims in disbelief.
65.4.B.0.jpg; Grrr! the machine gun fires rapidly.
65.4.C.0.jpg; Hmph! the creature cries sadly.
65.4.D.0.jpg; A white wolf-like figure stands in front of a colorful light.
65.4.E.0.jpg; A person's silhouette glows brightly over the water.
65.5.A.0.jpg; Owwie... He winces in pain.
65.5.B.0.jpg; Y-you were that stupid fish from a moment ago? he asks incredulously.
65.5.C.0.jpg; You surrendered so easily after a few hits! he teases.
65.5.D.0.jpg; I was told by my owner to come here and compete, i didn't know i was coming here to get beat up by you guys! he complains.
65.5.E.0.jpg; I can't believe the small form of the beast was a little child! she exclaims in surprise.
65.6.A.0.jpg; You must have a token on you. Hand it over before i do bad things to you! he demands.
65.6.B.0.jpg; Hmmm... He thinks carefully.
65.6.C.0.jpg; Asshole, first he beats me up, then he blackmails me! i'll let my owner know about this! he fumes angrily.
65.6.D.0.jpg; Huh? he questions curiously.
65.6.E.0.jpg; Another one! he exclaims underwater.
65.7.A.0.jpg; Whee whee whee! the red creature attacks the man.
65.7.B.0.jpg; He swims quickly towards the surface.
65.7.C.0.jpg; Haha, i'm going to let my steam off on you! the monster roars playfully.
65.7.D.0.jpg; That's a huge fish, i could make a high-quality sashimi out of you! he declares enthusiastically.
65.8.A.0.jpg; Hahaha, you've got the voice of a little bitch! the creature laughs loudly.
65.8.B.0.jpg; Ahh— he cries out as he falls.
65.8.C.0.jpg; The boots walk steadily towards the ocean.
65.8.D.0.jpg; World of the eternal. She gazes at the swirling blue portal.
65.9.A.0.jpg; I can't bear it anymore. He summons two glowing spheres.
65.9.B.0.jpg; Gold. He holds the coins gently.
65.9.C.0.jpg; I can't believe that after all this time, i'm finally here. He stares in shock at the portal.
65.9.D.0.jpg; Two birds fly peacefully over the beach.
66.0.A.0.jpg; Two women smile happily on a sandy beach.
66.0.B.0.jpg; It's a token! the girl exclaims, holding the orb.
66.0.C.0.jpg; Eh? i clearly saw rennes receive two tokens a moment ago. She questions confusedly.
66.0.D.0.jpg; Rennes was the first to arrive here and received two tokens. Whoever places second gets a single token. She explains.
66.0.E.0.jpg; All we need to do is maintain our second position! yeah! they agree excitedly.
66.1.A.0.jpg; And just like that, we easily pass the first round! he announces proudly.
66.1.B.0.jpg; There was obviously going to be a reward for defeating the monster. He explains, flipping the coins.
66.1.C.0.jpg; Modo, you guys can keep a token. Us? he asks politely.
66.1.D.0.jpg; We didn't think we'd be able to make it into the second round of the competition, being able to pass the first round is good enough for us. He's right, why don't you give it to your wife instead. They discuss.
66.1.E.0.jpg; Take it, my original plan was for both of you guys to have a token each. He offers generously.
66.2.A.0.jpg; Yi bei, take this one! she offers kindly.
66.2.B.0.jpg; It's apparent that you want to head into the second round. He observes with a smile.
66.2.C.0.jpg; I don't want it. Ah... She declines, crossing her arms.
66.2.D.0.jpg; Let's go, i'll gather my own tokens. She declares confidently.
66.2.E.0.jpg; I see, she's lost all her powers, but she hasn't lost her dignity as a queen! hehe, if they don't want it, we can... He plans slyly.
66.3.A.0.jpg; She's right, i'm judging you too. He teases playfully.
66.3.B.0.jpg; Xiang ye, don't let up, we'll catch up to you! he encourages excitedly.
66.3.C.0.jpg; Let's go! let's go! he urges the group forward.
66.3.D.0.jpg; She stands quietly in front of the shimmering wall.
66.3.E.0.jpg; A fiery red eye glows intensely.
66.4.A.0.jpg; It's over. She accepts her fate sadly.
66.4.B.0.jpg; Woah, the forest is on fire! they exclaim in surprise.
66.4.C.0.jpg; The fire spreads rapidly through the forest.
66.5.A.0.jpg; The flames engulf the beastly man in pain.
66.5.B.0.jpg; We collected another three tokens, now we have six in total, do we still need to stop them? he asks thoughtfully.
66.5.C.0.jpg; Brother, i promised yalu that i would finish xiang ye. He vows determinedly.
66.5.D.0.jpg; This fire won't kill them, my idea is to lure out the guardian of this forest. Hehe... He explains with a smirk.
66.5.E.0.jpg; Let's move on, if we manage to lure the guardian out, it might actually kill them here! she suggests eagerly.
66.6.A.0.jpg; The group walks through the forest.
66.6.B.0.jpg; Hmm? he looks down curiously.
66.6.C.0.jpg; Wahhhh! he cries out in surprise.
66.6.D.0.jpg; Snake! snake! he yells, startled.
66.6.E.0.jpg; They're all trying to escape... He observes worriedly.
66.7.A.0.jpg; Burning the forest during the competition, whose bright idea was this? he questions angrily.
66.7.B.0.jpg; No, this fire was manmade! she clarifies urgently.
66.7.C.0.jpg; Do you think this was rennes? unlikely. Even though rennes has a less likeable attitude, he wouldn't do such a thing as this. They discuss uncertainly.
66.7.D.0.jpg; A large, dark shape obscures his vision.
66.7.E.0.jpg; Just take care of yourself. He warns sternly.
66.7.F.0.jpg; That's the magic of the twin sisters! she realizes with shock.
66.8.A.0.jpg; It sounds like someone's fighting! he exclaims worriedly.
66.8.B.0.jpg; You are an idiot. She scolds sharply.
66.8.C.0.jpg; Release my sister! she demands fiercely.
66.8.D.0.jpg; You pathetic humans, disrupting the balance of life in this forest. The tree-like creatures sneer.
66.8.E.0.jpg; A young girl with brown hair is tied up helplessly.
67.0.A.0.jpg; Leave, humans! the creature roars angrily.
67.0.B.0.jpg; A dark purple energy radiates from the circle.
67.0.C.0.jpg; The woman struggles against the glowing sigil.
67.1.A.0.jpg; The tree creatures clash with knives in a flurry of motion.
67.1.B.0.jpg; Aisha! the girl calls out urgently.
67.1.C.0.jpg; So many groots! he exclaims in surprise.
67.1.D.0.jpg; Humans are so hate-worthy, we will never forgive you. If... The creature threatens menacingly.
67.1.E.0.jpg; The fist strikes the creature powerfully.
67.2.A.0.jpg; The tree monster throws the woman backward with force.
67.2.B.0.jpg; She swings her sword through the air with determination.
67.2.C.0.jpg; Attack! the girls launch a powerful attack on the root.
67.2.D.0.jpg; The woman slices through the rocky humanoid with her sword.
67.3.A.0.jpg; I'm not afraid! she declares bravely.
67.3.B.0.jpg; A large rock falls and breaks apart, and the tree's roots begin to grow.
67.3.C.0.jpg; It's healing itself! he exclaims in alarm.
67.3.D.0.jpg; It's useless. She states sadly.
67.3.E.0.jpg; They have regenerative powers, that's why my sister and i couldn't defeat them earlier. She says with a shocked expression.
67.4.A.0.jpg; Why don't i just give them my fist of fire! no. He says quickly.
67.4.C.0.jpg; The surroundings are super dry, you'd start an even bigger fire! he states seriously.
67.4.D.0.jpg; That's right, my sister is still in their hands too... He explains sadly.
67.4.E.0.jpg; Hey tree guys! she shouts loudly.
67.4.F.0.jpg; We only want to cross this forest, and we don't mean to cause any harm! he says with a smile.
67.5.A.0.jpg; You started the fire, and now you want to plead! the creature says angrily.
67.5.B.0.jpg; None of you are leaving here today! and talking doesn't work, time to switch to fighting! the creatures yell.
67.5.D.0.jpg; The creature strains in the fire.
67.6.A.0.jpg; Why is there such a large forest fire here? he asks curiously.
67.6.B.0.jpg; You humans started it! the tree-like figure yells angrily.
67.6.C.0.jpg; He stares intensely, unless others are ahead of him.
67.6.D.0.jpg; This fire may have summoned the forest spirits.
67.6.E.0.jpg; He cannot use his abilities, so he quickly leaves.
67.7.A.0.jpg; He lets the man go this time.
67.7.B.0.jpg; A small rat lies still on the ground.
67.7.C.0.jpg; The creature carefully examines the injured rat.
67.7.D.0.jpg; The woman sits sadly in the forest.
67.8.A.0.jpg; Fucking humans... He says angrily.
67.8.B.0.jpg; The crystal shatters from the boulder.
