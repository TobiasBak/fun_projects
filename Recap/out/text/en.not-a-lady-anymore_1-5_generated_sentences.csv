1.0.B.0.jpg;  "You are no longer my daughter." the white-haired man declared. "You tried to assassinate a pro-Orabi. You are a criminal."
1.0.B.1.jpg;  The pink-haired girl kneels before her father.
1.0.C.0.jpg; We learn that Countess Adelbor was a girl thirsty for love. If you want to be loved by your family...to make you stand out, hiding your charms...contempt from one's fiance.
1.0.C.1.jpg; "I've put up with it all." the young girl in the white dress thought sadly. She has been abused and rejected by her family.
1.1.A.0.jpg; But Adela, who was crushed by that heart, eventually.
1.1.A.1.jpg; I closed the door of my heart and fell into the darkness.
1.1.B.jpg; She went into dark black magic and was eventually executed.

1.1.E.0.jpg;  Her eyes wide with shock, the pink-haired woman seemed to be reliving a painful memory. "I fainted like that." she thought, her breath catching in her throat.
1.1.E.1.jpg;  "I'm the one who got hurt...there's no one to look after me...that's like Adela."
1.2.A.jpg;  "Gosh." she sighed, sinking onto the edge of the bed, her pink hair cascading down her back. "You're up, miss." 
1.2.B.0.jpg; "I can't believe I hit my head against a wall at 13 years old." the blonde woman muttered, her annoyance evident. "You're also very stupid."
1.2.B.1.jpg;  A blonde woman in a maid's outfit stood in the doorway, a disapproving frown on her face as she pointed a finger at someone unseen.
1.2.C.jpg; "Aren't you ashamed of your last name, Laver?" The words hung in the air, leaving the pink-haired woman blushing and confused.  "The name of this..." 
1.2.D.0.jpg;  "Maid is Panza." the blonde maid declared, her gaze steady and confident. "I'm not responding back, so I'll be in high spirits. You must be a very scary man who bothers me all the time." But even as she spoke, a flicker of uncertainty crossed her features. "Until now, the memory of living as Adela has not disappeared."
12.D.1.jpg;  The white-haired man gazed at the two women before him, their faces turned away, and a profound sadness settled over him.  "I don't feel like I want to be loved by them anymore." 
1.2.E.jpg;  "Oh, by the way, I brought lunch." the blonde maid chirped, a cheerful smile on her face as she held out a plate laden with food. "This is enough for you, isn't it?"
1.2.F.0.jpg;  The pink-haired woman eyed the plate of food, a cruel and calculating glint in her eyes. "Or maybe..." she thought, a sinister plan forming in her mind. 
1.2.F.1.jpg;  "The incompetent spirituality of the Laver family." the maid thought with a smirk, her finger tapping against her lips. .com 
1.2.G.0.jpg;   "You didn't think I could eat the same meal as others, did you?"  The pink-haired woman glared at the food, her disgust palpable.  .com 
1.2.G.1.jpg;  "That's enough." the blonde maid soothed, her hand resting gently on the pink-haired woman's shoulder.  "If you're destined to be executed, even if you stick with it..." 
1.2.H.jpg;  The blonde maid watched with growing concern as the pink-haired woman sat silently on the bed.  "Lady? You haven't said anything for a while." 
1.3.A.jpg;  "If you answer every single word..." the pink-haired woman hissed, a sinister blue aura enveloping her as the blonde maid watched in alarm.
1.3.B.jpg;  A bloodcurdling scream pierced the air - "Aaaah!!" - echoing down the hallway from behind the closed door. 
1.3.D.jpg;   "Lord!!" the terrified maid cried, rushing towards the white-haired man, who stood calmly in the hallway, a knowing smirk playing on his lips.
1.3.E.jpg;  "What's this noise? What is happening?" the white-haired man asked, his brow furrowed in confusion as the maid gaped at him in shock.
1.3.F.0.jpg; "Lady Adela is running wild!" the brown-haired maid exclaimed, her face etched with worry. 
1.3.G.jpg;  "Don't tell me I told the lord who's serving me to eat." one maid hissed, her expression defiant. "You won't say you can't eat it, right?!" 
1.3.H.jpg;  "I'm sorry!" the maid cried out in shock, her eyes fixed on the pink-haired woman who stood triumphantly over the fallen blonde man.  
1.3.I.jpg;  Tears streamed down the blonde maid's face as she sobbed, "Please forgive me!"
1.3.J.jpg;  "Ugh!" the blonde maid whimpered, cowering beneath the pink-haired woman's furious gaze. "Young lady, miss, please be merciful..."
1.3.K.jpg;  "Haah!" the pink-haired woman laughed, her eyes bright with cruel amusement. "Don't tell the lord who's serving you." she mocked. "I can't believe that Panza is making this face! Cough, cough." 
1.4.A.0.jpg;  "Even if such an incompetent young-ae brags." the brown-haired woman scoffed, her disdain for the pink-haired girl evident. 
1.4.A.1.jpg;  "If you don't have skills, it's ridiculous." the brown-haired woman spat, her anger palpable. 
1.4.B.0.jpg;  "The servants making fun of you is something that suits you." the brown-haired woman sneered at the pink-haired girl.  "Sharon, Sharon... you've gone too far." 
1.4.B.1.jpg; "How much Adela has reduced our family's status." the brown-haired woman lamented. "I'm sure your father knows it well.  Who can't use magic at all after the blood of a famous family." 
1.4.C.jpg;  "It's a disgrace to the family." the words hung in the air, heavy with disappointment, as the pink-haired girl stared at the floor, her shame a palpable weight on her small shoulders. 
1.4.D.jpg;   "Yeah, I'm a less distant daughter." she thought, a spark of defiance igniting in her eyes, a newfound resolve to rely on herself blooming in her chest. 
1.4.E.0.jpg;  "It's written as such...because all the time, 'The successor must be his brother." she read, her frustration mounting with each word, the injustice of it all burning in her throat. 
1.4.E.1.jpg;  He stood tall, a confident smirk playing on his lips, his red eyes gleaming with ambition from behind his glasses, a sea of blue flowers framing his self-assured figure. 
1.4.F.0.jpg;  "That's what I said..." the brown-haired woman murmured, her gaze distant, lost in contemplation, a quiet confidence radiating from her. 
1.4.F.1.jpg;  Doubts gnawed at her, the weight of her necklace suddenly heavy as she fingered it, a flicker of uncertainty dimming the usual fire in her red eyes. 
1.4.G.0.jpg;  "She's been brainwashed." someone whispered, their voice filled with concern. "My mother, a former..." The single tear escaping the pink-haired woman's eye spoke volumes.
1.4.G.1.jpg;  "Countess...died as soon as she gave birth to me." the black-haired woman stated. devoid of emotion, as the pink-haired girl before her stood stiffly, the weight of the unspoken grief hanging heavy in the air.
1.4.H.0.jpg;  "After that, the stepmother, Medis, came in." someone narrated, anticipation lacing their tone. The woman in red, a black fan clutched in her hand, smiled slyly. "I want to make my son..." 
1.4.H.1.jpg;  "I want to make my son, Sharon, his successor." she declared. "I would have been in the way. I'm afraid you don't have the quality of a successor." 
1.5.A.0.jpg;  "But I can help La Verga out of sight." the black-haired woman said.  "If you act within your means, I and your father will love you. You can't use magic. You shouldn't be better than your brother. If you want to survive in this world..." The words felt like a cage, suffocating the young girl clutching her stuffed rabbit.
1.5.A.1.jpg;  "To be loved by your family..." the black-haired woman thought, a bitter smile twisting her lips. "She used to tell me this when I was a child. Maybe it's because of my mother's death...since then, the people of the mansion have treated me as if I were dirty. An indifferent father...a new family..."
1.5.B.0.jpg;  "I wanted to be loved by everyone." Adela mused, her eyes closed as Medis's words echoed in her mind.  "I had no choice but to recall that Medis' words were the correct answer. Strangely! A girl who wished for love..." 
1.5.B.1.jpg;  "This is how Adela in the novel was born." she thought sadly, her hands clasped together as if in prayer, a single white flower a stark contrast to the darkness surrounding her. 
1.5.C.jpg;  A mischievous glint sparkled in her pink eyes. "But...it doesn't matter now, does it, Medis?" 
1.5.D.jpg;  "What?" the brown-haired woman exclaimed, her eyes widening in surprise.  "Ah...Adela." the other woman said. "What are you talking about all of a sudden?" 
1.5.E.jpg;  The truth settled in her mind, calm and unwavering:  "It's not that I can't use magic, it's just that I didn't use it."
1.5.F.jpg;  "Sharon's brother..."  Adela thought, her brow furrowed in confusion as the other woman's surprised gaze met hers.
1.5.G.jpg;  "To make him the heir to the Laver family." The words seemed to echo off the shocked silence that followed, a collective gasp hanging in the air.  "?!?!" 
1.6.A.0.jpg; "Heheh. Hahahaha! I was wondering what you were saying!" The dark-haired woman threw back her head and laughed, her earlier seriousness completely forgotten. 
1.6.A.1.jpg;  "You're out of your mind, Adela!" her brother scoffed, throwing his head back in laughter, his amusement a stark contrast to Adela's growing anxiety.
1.6.B.0.jpg;  "The biggest tree in the garden..." He pointed towards the towering oak. "If you're really better than me..."  Intrigue hung in the air, the challenge issued.
1.6.B.1.jpg;  The air crackled with magic as the tree groaned and split, leaves swirling around a stunned Adela. Her brother turned to her, his eyes wide with concern. 
1.6.C.jpg;  Unease settled over the room, the man with the ponytail staring ahead, his expression troubled, as the woman behind him gasped, her eyes darting between him and the white-haired man, whose face was etched with worry.

1.6.E.0.jpg;  He bowed low, his head hung in apology. "Sorry...this is how I..." Hope flickered in Adela's eyes as she looked down at her brother. 
1.6.E.1.jpg;   "For the first time in my life, I succeeded in getting an apology from my brother." Adela thought, a quiet satisfaction washing over her.  .com 
1.7.A.jpg;  The grand manor stood bathed in sunlight, its windows gleaming, a beacon of warmth and happiness amidst the lush greenery.
2.0.A.jpg;  "I'm sorry for bothering you until now!" a voice called out, the words echoing around the majestic manor. "2"  A sense of calm settled over the scene. 
2.0.B.jpg;  "Now, try to follow along!"  Adela beamed, her graduation gown swirling around her as she brandished her wooden stick, her excitement contagious. 
2.0.C.jpg; "Hum hum..." the silver-haired man murmured, his brow furrowed with concern as he exchanged a worried look with the dark-haired woman beside him.
2.0.D.jpg;  "Adela...you can't possibly..."  His red eyes narrowed, suspicion clouding his features. "You didn't touch black magic, right?"
2.0.E.0.jpg;   "So, you've been hiding your magic all this time and lying about it..." The dark-haired woman's eyes widened in shock. "Well...yes, that's right!" Adela declared, a triumphant smirk spreading across her face. "There's no way Adela has that kind of power...!"  A surge of magic erupted, banishing any lingering doubts. "Since neither of you seem to realize it yet..." 
2.0.E.1.jpg;  "I'll keep adding fuel to the fire every time you get close to figuring it out."  Adela announced, her eyes gleaming with mischief.  "You both love receiving so much 'black magic,' after all. I showed you the magic to prove it to you." 
2.1.A.0.jpg;  "And now this is black magic?" The dark-haired woman threw her hands up in exasperation.  "The people in this house are so obsessed with putting Adela in trouble." 
2.1.A.1.jpg; "Hmph." Adela scoffed, her gaze cold. "Adela doesn't use black magic." 
2.1.B.0.jpg;  "I guess you and Ora-brother have different thoughts?" the dark-haired woman asked. "It's easy to dismiss your power as black magic." 
2.1.B.1.jpg;  "But...I've never sent you out of the mansion before." Adela countered, her brow furrowed in confusion as she paused on the grand staircase.  "As my father said, if it's true that you use black magic..." 
2.1.C.jpg;  The dark-haired woman stared at the floor, her arms crossed tightly, a mixture of worry and confusion etched on her face as Adela turned away from her.
2.1.D.0.jpg;   "What are you trying to say?" the dark-haired woman demanded. "Books that you would have learned magic..."  A determined glint entered her eyes, the shadows of the room seemingly deepening around her.  
2.1.D.1.jpg;  "Laverga...it becomes the question of whether you own books about black magic." The weight of the accusation hung heavy in the air, reflected in the worry etched on the brown-haired woman's face.
2.1.E.0.jpg;  "They are not foolish enough to strangle their own family." the dark-haired woman thought, her gaze cold, the image of a falling rock crushing two unsuspecting heads flashing through her mind. 
2.1.E.1.jpg;   Confusion reigned as Adela's eyes widened in shock, her gaze clashing with her brother's, his frustration evident in the set of his jaw, the opulent surroundings doing little to ease the tension.  
2.1.F.0.jpg;  "Brother-!" Adela cried out.  .com 
2.1.F.1.jpg;  "High...don't be." Adela whispered, her arms tightening around her brother's surprised form, her joy palpable.

2.1.G.1.jpg;   "I'm most happy now!" Adela declared, her face radiant with joy as a hand gently ruffled her hair. "Adela, yours...after all, after you hit your head, you became weird, right?!" 
2.2.A.1.jpg; "Adela says." a voice echoed through the grand hall, drawing attention to the top of the opulent staircase, the sparkling chandelier a beacon of light.
2.2.B.jpg;  "Seeing that, you have a place to eat." the black-haired man observed, his gaze fixed on the women before him. "I hid my strength because my mother told me to do it." the black-haired woman confessed. "Mother, why did you do that?" Adela whispered, her brow furrowed in confusion. 
2.2.C.0.jpg;  "It's all for you! You!" the black-haired woman cried, her eyes shining with a manic joy, her arms outstretched as if she were bestowing a precious gift.  .com 
2.2.C.1.jpg; "Atilla is just a hindrance!" the black-haired woman spat.  "Look, now you could be the next Gajil. Isn't this the fruit of my efforts?"
2.2.D.0.jpg; "Sharon!"  A mischievous grin spread across the black-haired woman's face, her red eyes gleaming with anticipation.
2.2.D.1.jpg; "If you're a mother, you can understand how your mom feels...!" she pleaded, her arms outstretched. 
2.2.E.jpg;   Adela gasped, her eyes widening in alarm as a powerful force erupted before her, the black-haired woman's hand outstretched, her expression a mask of fierce determination.
2.2.F.0.jpg; "...I can do as much as knocking down trees in the garden." the pink-haired girl observed, her brow furrowed in thought. "Water magic has long since been learned." the other woman added, her tone laced with skepticism. 
2.2.F.1.jpg;  "Shah...Sharon?" The black-haired woman's voice was laced with concern as she placed a hand on the white-haired man's shoulder, her gaze searching his face. "Did you care about the tree that fell?"
2.3.A.0.jpg;  The hand, glowing with blue energy, shot forward. "Without getting my mother's hands dirty...beat Atilla with my skills." a determined voice vowed, the power thrumming in the air.

3.3.E.1.jpg;  "What are you hesitating for? Hurry up and apologize for breaking the window." a voice commands impatiently.

3.3.J.jpg;  "What...?"  The man with light blue hair blinks in confusion, his brow furrowed. "Please forgive me." he adds.
3.4.A.jpg;  "If I were to talk to my father about you, it wouldn't even be a big deal to bring down Beig completely." the man with light blue hair thinks, his gaze hardening with anger as the woman with pink hair observes him with growing concern. 
3.4.B.0.jpg;  "...Do as you please." the woman with pink hair states, her hand outstretched in a gesture of defiance. "What did you say?" she demands.
3.4.B.1.jpg;  "...Do you hate your family?" the text hangs in the air, a silent question that makes the man with light blue hair flinch. "...To the point where you'd go on a rampage just to be disowned."  Surprise and anger flash across his face. 
3.4.C.jpg;   The majestic castle of Laverka stands tall against the backdrop of a peaceful sky.  "Something like Laverka." the text floats above it, a sense of hope in its simplicity. "It doesn't matter what happens."
3.4.D.0.jpg;   "...Yes." The woman with pink hair's eyes widen in shock as the man with light blue hair nods resolutely, his gaze unwavering. 
3.4.D.1.jpg;  The young woman with pink hair sighs quietly, her eyes closed as she processes his words. "...I see." she murmurs, a hint of sadness in her voice.  "...So you were also being excluded by your family." 
3.4.E.0.jpg;  "Maybe people who are rejected can do something together."  The young man with white hair scowls, looking down at his hands. "Don't talk to me!" he snaps.  "I feel uncomfortable just seeing your face. Don't try to climb on the count's incompetent lady."
3.4.E.1.jpg;  "You shouldn't be here in the first place." the young man with blue hair sighs, his brow furrowed with concern as he looks down at the young woman with pink hair lying on the bed. "I'm sorry." he adds. "Compared to that, just being able to talk is probably better. What are you doing lying on the bed!" 
3.4.F.jpg;  "It's exhausting to use magic." the young woman with pink hair sighs, burying her face in her hands.  "Are you sure you're a noble? Your behavior is..." 
3.5.A.jpg;  "I don't want to hear that from someone who doesn't even train in swordsmanship." the words repeat, echoing the speaker's frustration. "I'll tell you what's on my mind."
3.5.B.jpg;  "You're stupid." the young man with blue hair throws over his shoulder, his back turned as he walks away, his anger palpable. 
3.5.C.jpg;  "Unlike you, I have no talent." the young woman with pink hair admits. 
3.5.D.jpg;  "That's why I've decided never to take up the sword again." a woman declares, her hand hovering over something small, her determination evident as two swords hang on the wall behind her. 
3.5.E.jpg;  "I've had enough of..." the young man with blue hair mutters, his hand resting on the table, his face etched with annoyance. 
3.5.F.jpg;  "Their stares..." The young man with blue hair grits out the words, his eyes fixed on the young woman with pink hair as she holds a sword above her head, the point aimed downwards.  "And..."  The air crackles with anger and hostility. 
3.5.G.0.jpg;  "Iyat!"  The man with light blue hair stiffens, his eyes widening in shock.
3.5.G.1.jpg;  "What?!" The man with light blue hair roars, his silver sword flashing as he lunges forward. In the foreground, the woman with pink hair watches in shock.
3.5.H.jpg;  "Aahhhh?!" The woman with pink hair throws her hands up in alarm.  "What are you doing!" she cries, her face a mixture of shock and worry. "Well, let's show them a good time."
3.5.I.0.jpg;  The woman with pink hair brandishes a sword, her face etched with shock and worry as she locks eyes with the viewer.  Below her, the man with light blue hair shouts in alarm.
3.5.I.1.jpg;  "No, not for me. Not to me."  The man with light blue hair stares in disbelief, his face pale with shock. "You can't even take down one of the young noblewomen here?" 
3.5.J.jpg;  "That's not something to be taken lightly..." the man with light blue hair murmurs, his expression grim as he stares at the scene unfolding before him.
3.5.K.jpg;  "Don't ignore it." The woman with pink hair grins playfully, brandishing two swords as the man with light blue hair watches in bewildered amusement. 
3.6.A.0.jpg;  "I'll gladly give in to provocation! I'll give in to your provocations!" The man with light blue hair charges forward, his sword raised, determination etched on his face. 
3.6.A.1.jpg;  "Ah! Wait!" The man with light blue hair cries out in alarm, his eyes widening as he stumbles back. 
3.6.B.0.jpg;  "What! What are you doing this time?! You've lost!" The man with light blue hair stares at his sword in disbelief, his face a mask of shock. 
3.6.B.1.jpg;   "Your arm." the man with light blue hair says. her face creased with pain and fear. 
3.6.C.jpg;  "It fell off."  The young man with short purple hair stares in disbelief at the sight before him, his eyes wide with shock. 
4.0.A.jpg;   "How dare you make such a big fuss and then destroy yourself...to support us!"  Disdain drips from the words hanging in the air above the castle rooftop.
4.0.B.0.jpg;   "This is a bit like this in my country too." the man with blue hair says awkwardly.  Behind him, the woman with pink hair cringes. "Ah, it hurts...! And I'm embarrassed...!" she groans, wishing for a hole to swallow her. "I want to hide in a rat hole somewhere!"
4.0.B.1.jpg;  "It would be much better to be harassed by a maid!" the man with blue hair complains, his face a mask of annoyance.  The woman with pink hair, however, can't help but be amused by the situation. "Ahaha...rather than suffer this kind of humiliation, I would rather die...!" she whispers mischievously.  "What are you doing now?" 
4.0.C.0.jpg;  "Killing yourself in someone else's mansion?" Disgust and anger permeate the words. "Do not be ridiculous! Kill it!"
4.0.C.1.jpg;  "Please kill me--!" The words scrawled across the image scream despair and sorrow. 
4.1.A.jpg;  "Oh really!" The man with blue hair throws his head back in exasperation, his face a mask of annoyance.  "That's it, that's done!"
4.1.B.jpg;  "...Yes, you."  The man with blue hair glares down at the woman with pink hair, who shrinks away from him, her eyes squeezed shut.  "Why did you provoke me like that when you had no hope of winning?" he demands. 
4.1.C.0.jpg;  " ...I don't know either."  The woman with pink hair jumps, startled. "What?"  "Yes, that's right..." she continues.  "The reason I came here was to break the engagement contract." 
4.1.C.1.jpg;  The man with blue hair stands with his back to the viewer, a serious expression etched on his face. "but the sight of barrard talking about his family is like..." 
4.1.D.0.jpg;  The woman with pink hair stares down at her hand, a wave of disappointment washing over her. "if it were barrard drum in the novel, they would never have given me treatment like this." "the reason he became a crooked person in the future..."
4.1.D.1.jpg; With his back turned, the man hangs his head low, his sadness evident. "unlike my brother, i don't have any talent." 
4.1.E.jpg;  A heavy silence hangs in the air, filled only with unspoken questions.  "just like me" "because i was despised by my family...?"
4.2.A.jpg;  The woman with pink hair looks up in surprise as a hand gently touches her shoulder. "hey."
4.2.B.jpg; "Chin." she shouts. her face a mask of shock.  The man in the blue shirt and vest recoils in surprise. "why are you screaming?"
4.2.C.jpg;  The woman with pink hair lies peacefully on the floor, a serene smile gracing her lips. "treatment is over!"
4.2.D.jpg; The woman with pink hair, her expression laced with concern, mouths a silent "thanks_".  "go back quickly!" 
4.2.E.jpg;  Only her eye is visible, but the woman's serious expression speaks volumes.  "when i talked about my brother" "the only one who asked back." 
4.2.F.0.jpg;  The words hang in the air, heavy with meaning. "but i see reality more than you." "next time we meet" 
4.2.F.1.jpg;  The man in the opulent blue and purple outfit glares down. "don't ever talk about the sword in front of me again." 
4.2.G.jpg; "bye."  The young woman with pink hair calls out, a surprised expression etched on her face as she stands in the grand palace. 
4.3.A.jpg;  A red blur streaks across the image, a visual representation of sheer speed. "barreled!" 
4.3.B.0.jpg;  "tomorrow. and the day after tomorrow too." The young woman with pink hair calls after the grey-haired man, her pink eyes wide with determination. "i will come here every day!" 
4.3.B.1.jpg;  Her voice ringing with newfound confidence, the young woman in the white dress makes a bold request. "teach me the sword!"
4.3.C.jpg;  Disbelief and anger color the man's features as he stares down at the young woman. "... what?!" "didn't you hear what i said until now?!"
4.3.D.jpg;  "mr. barrard, i am..." the young woman begins. "i was planning to ask  barrard to break off the engagement."  Below her, the man's voice is sharp. "what?" 
4.3.E.jpg;  Doubt creeps in, casting a shadow over her resolve. "however, even if i ask the current barrels to break the engagement." "for some reason, i feel like i will regret it forever."
4.3.F.jpg;  "so i changed my mind." she declares.  "have you finally figured out that this constitutes an insult?" he roars, his face a mask of rage. 
4.4.A.jpg;  Standing tall in the elegant palace, the young woman throws down a challenge.  "i defeat you with a sword." 
4.4.B.jpg;  Her eyes sparkling with determination, the woman with long pink hair throws her head back and speaks. "to you who gave up everything" "the time to prove that you can achieve results by not giving up." "the time when i showed everything i could do."
4.4.C.jpg;  A sense of relief washes over her, and for the first time in a long time, she feels in control.  "only then did i feel refreshed." "i think i can ask you to break off your engagement."
4.4.D.0.jpg;  The woman with pink hair narrows her eyes, a dangerous glint in them, and a smirk plays on her lips. "i will give you the humiliation of losing to the woman you looked down on!" 
4.4.D.1.jpg;  Her laughter rings out, echoing in the room, her joy almost tangible.  "oh-hoho hohohohoh ohc!!"
4.4.E.jpg;  The man in the blue suit recoils, his face a mask of shock and confusion. "what is 'oh-hoho'!"
4.4.F.jpg;  "ohh..." The woman with pink hair tilts her head, her expression a mixture of curiosity and excitement. "...?"
4.4.G.jpg;  The man's brow furrows, worry etching lines on his face. "...but." "i don't want to put my family in debt..." The woman in the white dress listens patiently, her gaze steady. 
4.5.A.jpg;  The sun dips below the horizon, casting the building with the red roof in a warm glow. "that..." "you know what i feel...."
4.5.B.jpg;  Sunlight glints off the golden accents of the grand building, its white facade gleaming against the clear blue sky. 
4.5.C.jpg;  "you heard that rumor too, right?!" The question hangs in the air, echoing in the stillness of the opulent library. 
4.5.D.0.jpg;  A hand hovers over a surface, frozen in time, its stillness unsettling. "but why isn't it moving?" "knight commander"
4.5.D.1.jpg;   The man with long, dark blue hair stands tall, his arms crossed, his very presence radiating authority. "lord veig!"
4.5.E.0.jpg;  The blue-haired man's gaze sweeps over the room. "outsiders, be quiet."  "former knight commander griggs." "now you are"
4.5.E.1.jpg;  Head bowed, the pink-haired man stands before the bookshelf, his shoulders slumped with sadness. "just a lower class person from the slums."
4.6.A.0.jpg;  The air crackles with tension as the three men stare at the words, their faces contorted in anger and disgust.  "if you understand, go back to the garbage dump like a lower class person..."
4.6.A.1.jpg;  "fuck it!"  The blue-haired man lunges, his finger outstretched, just as the man with brown hair lashes out with his foot. 
4.6.B.0.jpg;   The pink-haired man winces, his face etched with concern and pain. "ugh. shin..."
4.6.B.1.jpg;  A new resolve fills the air, the words a call to action.  "if you don't move, i'll do it myself." "we can't allow the knights to become corrupt again!"
4.6.C.jpg;  The blue-haired man crumples to the ground, his hands braced against the wall, his eyes wide with shock and disbelief. 
4.6.D.0.jpg; "tsk! i can't communicate with nobles!" The pink-haired man mutters under his breath, his shoulders slumped in frustration as he walks away. 
4.6.D.1.jpg; The red-haired man chews on his lip, his brow furrowed with worry. "if i go now, i'll be kicked out by the knights..."
4.6.E.jpg;  He taps his finger to his forehead, a thoughtful expression on his face. "attract a lucky nobleman as an ally." 
4.7.A.jpg;  His eyes widen in horror as the red-haired man takes in the sight before him: his sword, shattered into a thousand pieces.  
4.7.B.0.jpg; "clink" The sound reaches the red-haired man's ears a split second before his eyes register the sight, his face morphing into an expression of pure surprise. 
4.7.B.1.jpg;  The red-haired man's back is to the viewer, but his mischievous intent is clear as he surveys the shattered window. "what are you doing? window destroyer!" 
4.7.C.jpg; "my hand slipped?!" The blue-haired man sputters, his jaw agape with shock. "but where is the guy who flies his sword all the way to the mansion?!"
4.7.D.jpg;  The red-haired man stands amidst the wreckage of the room, his gaze falling on a knife. "knife?" "did you swing it?" 
4.7.E.jpg;  The red-haired man shakes his head, sadness filling his eyes. "more than that, the voice now is" "veigue is so cruel?!" 
4.7.F.jpg;  Doubt and confusion cloud his thoughts, the very idea ludicrous. "no, that can't be possible!" "the guy who gets annoyed just by bringing up the memory of the sword?!"
4.7.G.jpg;  The red-haired man watches, his eyes narrowed, as the blue-haired man's jaw drops in astonishment. "wow?!" 
4.8.A.0.jpg;  "he's really the second son, right?!"  The blue-haired man gapes, his surprise mirrored in the wide eyes of the pink-haired girl standing behind him. 
4.8.A.1.jpg;  The blue-haired man spins around, sword clattering to the sandy ground, his arms thrown up in astonishment.  "who's the other one you're with?" the pink-haired girl asks, her gaze fixed on him. 
4.8.B.0.jpg;  The pink-haired man stares, his vibrant purple eyes wide with shock. "......?!" 
4.8.B.1.jpg;  A bright smile lights up the pink-haired girl's face, her joy infectious. 
5.0.A.0.jpg;  "to support us!" the blue-haired man exclaims, pointing at the pink-haired girl. "she looks like the daughter of a pretty good family?"  The pink-haired man frowns. "this is my first time seeing this face. who is it?"
5.0.A.1.jpg;  "don't come into my sight on the subject of the slum lower class." The pink-haired man warns, his arms crossed as he watches the blue-haired man walk away. "in the first place, the second son, who doesn't trust people very well, is worried about being alone with someone else." "natural disaster... catastrophe..."  "... it's like the destruction of the world." 
5.0.B.jpg;  "....."  The pink-haired man mutters, his face tight with anger. 
5.0.C.0.jpg;  The pink-haired man leans back, his curiosity piqued. "the former knight commander's curiosity is rising...!" 
5.0.C.1.jpg;  A confident smirk graces the pink-haired man's lips, his eyes twinkling. 
5.0.D.jpg;  The title gleams in bold black font, two pink stars flanking the Korean characters, promising another exciting chapter in the story.  
5.1.A.0.jpg;  "i noticed it when my arm was missing because i swung the knife a bit." The words hang in the air, thick with disdain. "with only this level of skill." "are you so proud in front of me?" 
5.1.A.1.jpg;   The blue-haired man stands frozen, sword clutched in his hands, as the pink-haired woman glares at him, her fists clenched. "oh.. in my mind, he was the strongest swordsman!"
5.1.B.jpg;  "what's going on in your head?" The pink-haired woman demands, tears streaming down her face as she confronts the blue-haired man. "bring the blown sword yourself."  "yes....." he mumbles, his brow creased in confusion. 
5.1.C.jpg;  "ugh. i'm going to study swordsmanship in my previous life!" The pink-haired woman cries, burying her face in her hands. 
5.1.D.jpg;  The pink-haired woman gasps, her eyes wide with disbelief. "- you don't have to go pick it up?" The dark-haired man raises an eyebrow, his expression a mixture of amusement and annoyance. 
5.1.E.0.jpg;  "gah!" The pink-haired woman cries, clapping a hand over her mouth as a sword whizzes past her head.  "i was walking down the hallway."  "i was surprised when a sword flew in front of me."  The man in the grey shirt smiles sheepishly.  
5.1.E.1.jpg;  Confusion reigns as the pieces slowly come together. "i wondered what was going on."  "i was surprised that there was a second son of the baig family."
5.2.A.jpg;  The red-haired man flashes a carefree grin at the pink-haired woman, the sword held casually across his back. She stares back, her brow furrowed in confusion. 
5.2.B.0.jpg;  "ruler."  The red-haired man offers the sword, his smile unwavering. "is this right?" The pink-haired woman hesitantly reaches out, her expression a mixture of surprise and uncertainty. 
5.2.B.1.jpg;   "thank you." The red-haired man beams, his gaze fixed on the pink-haired woman.  "excuse me."  Behind him, the blue-haired man glowers.  "perhaps you!"  He growls. 
5.2.C.0.jpg;  The woman with pink hair stares, her mouth agape in stunned recognition. "you... you are!"  "grigs?!" "mr. griggs?!"
5.2.C.1.jpg; The pink-haired man leans back, his purple eyes sparkling with amusement, a knowing smirk playing on his lips. 
5.2.D.jpg; "...you are here"  The blue-haired man murmurs, his brow furrowed with concern.  "obviously... the leader of the knights of this kingdom." "in the novel, only the name of the election appears..."  Beside him, the pink-haired woman's eyes widen in alarm.
5.2.E.jpg;  "...the fact that you are here..." the blue-haired man begins, his gaze searching the woman's face. "did you come to see rod?"  The woman with pink hair looks back at him, her surprise evident.
5.3.A.0.jpg;  "the story is progressing quickly."  The pink-haired man muses, a mischievous glint in his eye. "come to think of it, you too..."  "embezzlement of knight order funds." 
5.3.A.1.jpg;  "repetitive violence against civilians." The blue-haired man's voice trembles with shock.  The pink-haired woman avoids his gaze, her cheeks flushing with shame. "resulting in even the members being accused." "i was expelled from the knight order."
5.3.B.0.jpg;  The blue-haired man hangs his head, the weight of his past sins heavy on his shoulders. "on the subject of rodenwald's shame..."
5.3.B.1.jpg;  "grasp!"  Fingers tighten around the hilt of the silver sword, the grip resolute. 
5.3.C.jpg;  "i'm so excited to appear in front of you!" The blue-haired man charges, his face a mask of grim determination, the silver sword gleaming. The pink-haired man shrinks back, fear contorting his features.
5.3.D.0.jpg;   "barard!" The pink-haired woman cries out, her eyes wide with terror, her feet scrambling for purchase as she runs. 
5.3.D.1.jpg;  The hand flashes out, two fingers gripping the knife, the motion a blur against the black backdrop. "cut"
5.4.A.jpg;  "with your bare hands...?!"  The pink-haired girl gapes up at the blue-haired boy, her eyes wide with disbelief.  He smiles down at her, unfazed. "sorry, but that's two people."
5.4.B.jpg;  "oops"  The blue-haired boy stammers, his eyes widening as he finds himself holding the pink-haired boy's sword.   "well, the wife from the slums has no explanation"  the pink-haired boy declares, his face a mask of mock despair. "i don't think the precious people will listen to me."
5.4.C.0.jpg;  "but your brother he warmly promised that if"  The blue-haired boy's voice is filled with concern as he rests his arm on the pink-haired boy's shoulder. 
5.4.C.1.jpg;  "i join the knights, he will spare my life." The pink-haired boy swings the sword, his face a mixture of desperation and anger.  The blue-haired boy watches, his expression unreadable.
5.4.D.jpg;  A struggle ensues, the blue-haired boy's grip firm as he restrains the pink-haired boy, their legs a tangle of limbs. 
5.4.E.jpg;  "my life is precious."  The pink-haired boy whispers, his gaze fixed on the fallen sword, a deep sadness etched on his face. 
5.4.F.jpg;  "work... hot!"  The blue-haired boy groans, wiping his brow as he sits beside the pink-haired girl.  "i couldn't help but come out with tears in my eyes." she murmurs. 
5.5.A.0.jpg;  "isn't that just a compliment?"  The pink-haired girl frowns, her brow furrowed in thought. "...i don't know anything about griggs."  "even in novels it wasn't as deeply related to attila as barrard."
5.5.A.1.jpg;  The pink-haired boy walks, the sword held loosely at his side, his mind awhirl with memories. "because he when adela's story began" 
5.5.B.0.jpg;  The words loom large against the dark background, stark and unforgiving. "as a great sinner who conspired with a warlock and tried to destroy the country."  "because he was executed horribly."
5.5.B.1.jpg;  The guillotine stands tall, a cruel silhouette against the blood-red sky, its blade a promise of a gruesome end. 
5.5.C.0.jpg;  "i can't believe you are using your position on your back to indulge in self-interest and ultimately try to take over this country.  what a foolish man this is."  The pink-haired girl spits the words, her fists clenched tight in prayer, her anger palpable. "ah... i'm sure all the"
5.5.C.1.jpg;  A wave of despair washes over her, the words echoing her thoughts. "the text people in this country might be like that man." "adila fell into the darkness" "a character used as a production to once again recognize the foolishness of this country." "there wasn't even any mention of griggs' inner story in the story."
5.5.D.jpg;  "but...just now clearly" she begins, her brow furrowed in thought. "they said it was because of a false accusation that got them expelled from the knights templar."
5.5.E.jpg;  The two swords lie forgotten, their weight insignificant compared to the questions swirling in the air. "when i only thought about the image in the story, i thought he was a vicious person, but..."  "so who is this beautiful lady that the second son is looking after?"
5.6.A.jpg;  The pink-haired man's grip tightens around the woman's hand, his expression unwavering despite the young blue-haired boy's furious glare. 
5.6.B.0.jpg;  "my fianc..." The blue-haired boy growls, his fist clenched so tight his knuckles turn white. "don't touch it with dirty hands!"
5.6.B.1.jpg;  "hey... fianc?!" The word hangs in the air, thick with disbelief, as the blue-haired boy stares at the couple, his eyes wide with shock. 
5.6.C.jpg;  The pink-haired girl smiles apologetically.  "sorry for the delay in introducing adela laver." 
5.6.D.jpg; The man with pink hair turns to the smiling woman in the grand room, shocked. "The Laver family?!" he exclaims, eyes wide with surprise. "If it's the Laver, then... you're a magician!" she says, a playful smile gracing her lips. 
5.6.E.jpg; "The Laver family?!" the man with pink hair repeats, his eyes wide with disbelief and confusion. 
5.6.F.jpg; "If it's the Laver, then... you're a magician!" echoes in the air, leaving a sense of intrigue and excitement hanging in the balance.
5.7.A.0.jpg; In the peaceful garden setting, the red-haired man stammers, "Hey, there are so many things I want to ask. It's surprising that the second son is with someone else... It's surprising that the second son is with someone else... That person is your fiance and they are even having a normal conversation?" His words are met with a shocked expression from the blue-haired man before him.
5.7.A.1.jpg; The blue-haired woman raises an eyebrow, a confused look on her face. "Are you being sarcastic?" she questions, taken aback. "Moreover, the wizard also practiced dwarf swordsmanship... What's all the fuss about?" 
5.7.B.0.jpg;  The woman with pink hair flashes a bright smile as she walks confidently away from the shocked blue-haired man, the red-haired man trailing behind her, his expression serious. 
5.7.B.1.jpg; The blue-haired man takes a step towards the departing woman, hand outstretched, his expression a mix of confusion and curiosity.  "Huh? Why are you acting like this all of a sudden?" he calls after her, the red-haired man looking down curiously at the woman's feet. 
5.7.C.0.jpg;  The pink-haired man paces anxiously in the white room, a worried expression etched on his face. "The rude bastard who kicked my leg..." he mutters, consumed by thoughts of revenge for his injury.
5.7.C.1.jpg;  The light blue-haired man stares in disbelief, surprised by the sight before him. "The stupid younger brother in our family... finally... is that your fiance?" he questions, his words echoing in the light blue room.
5.8.A.0.jpg; The man with long blue hair, his black and blue coat billowing slightly in the breeze, stands before the imposing building, a palpable sense of anxiety washing over him. 
5.8.A.1.jpg;  His hands clenched into white-knuckled fists, the man in the purple and blue robe strides away from the building, his back tensed with worry and fear. 
5.8.B.jpg;  The woman with pink hair stares at the viewer, her eyes wide with surprise. "...!" she gasps, her expression a mixture of shock and disbelief. 
5.8.C.0.jpg;  "... I see." the pink-haired woman murmurs sadly, her gaze downcast. "That person... is the cause of the barrel being crooked." she concludes, a sense of foreboding washing over her. 
5.8.C.1.jpg; "Current commander of the Odenwald Knights... Rodbake..." the blue-haired man whispers, his eyes wide with surprise as he turns away. "All three... are you...?" he trails off, his expression a mixture of shock and disbelief.
5.8.D.jpg; "Injured?" a voice asks from behind the pink-haired woman. "Heh!" she replies with a smile, glancing over her shoulder at the red-haired man who covers his face with his hand. 
1.2.D.1.jpg;  A man with long white hair sadly watches the two women in front of him walk away into the snowy distance. "i don't feel like i want to be loved by them anymore."
