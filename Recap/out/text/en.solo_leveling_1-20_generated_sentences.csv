1.0.A.jpg; The hand, covered in blood, rested on a cold stone, the fingers spread wide as if grasping for something to hold onto. "My name is Sung Jin-Woo." he whispered, the words a stark contrast to the pain etched on his face. 
1.0.B.jpg; Clutching his bleeding wounds, the young man struggled to rise from the cold floor. Despite the pain etched across his face, Sung Jin-Woo's eyes burned with determination.
1.1.A.0.jpg; He stumbled forward, his legs heavy with exhaustion, blood staining the ground beneath him. "Haa." he gasped, the sound a desperate plea for air. 
1.1.A.1.jpg; The white shoe lay abandoned on the floor, a silent testament to the violence that had unfolded. Blood, thick and viscous, pooled around the shoe, painting the tiles a gruesome crimson.
1.2.A.0.jpg; Three figures, clad in imposing armor, stood tall and imposing. Each held a long spear, the tips glowing with a menacing blue light. "Lowest rank and weakest hunter." they seemed to whisper, their words laced with a cold disdain. 
1.2.A.1.jpg;  He sat on the platform, his eyes wide with fear. Two towering figures, their armor shimmering with a spectral blue, loomed over him.  "I never expected this to happen to me." he muttered.
1.3.A.jpg; His breath came in ragged gasps, his face contorted with exertion. "Haa." he wheezed, each breath a struggle against the relentless pressure.
1.4.A.0.jpg; "God-dammit." he growled, his anger burning hot within him. His teeth clenched, his eyes narrowed, and his face contorted into a mask of pure rage. 
1.4.A.1.jpg;  The figure rose, a surge of power propelling it skyward. The armor, a shining beacon of defiance, gleamed with an aggressive blue light. 
1.5.A.jpg; The city stretched out before him, a sprawling metropolis of steel and glass.  Seoul, South Korea. The name felt distant, almost unreal, as if he were witnessing it from a dream. 
1.6.A.0.jpg; The man with the band-aid adjusted his green backpack as he walked, glancing at the men beside him. He muttered to himself, "If you disregard my slightly abnormal strength and regeneration..."
1.6.A.1.jpg; The three men continued walking, their blue and purple pants blending with the urban landscape.  One mumbled to himself, "It's embarrassing to even call myself a hunter."
1.7.A.jpg;  He walked with his group, his troubled expression mirroring his inner thoughts.  "Of course, I'm always getting hurt and even had a lot of near-death experiences." he thought.  "The job where your life's on the line, the hunter... I'm not doing this because I like it."
1.7.B.jpg;  The construction site in Seoul buzzed with activity, a whirlwind of dust and smoke.  Workers scurried around heavy machinery, their faces grim.
1.8.A.0.jpg;  The blue and white construction site stood silent, shrouded in a thick haze.  "I barely pay my rent." a man thought.
1.8.A.1.jpg; Leaning against the blue truck, the man looked down at his feet, his face etched with despair. "My sick mother's medical bills with what the hunter's guild pays me." he murmured.  "For a normal person with no particular talent, I had no choice but to become a hunter."
1.8.B.jpg; The man in the blue jacket greeted his friend, a smile lighting up his face.  "Here, good luck on your raid today." he said, handing him a small bag.  "Thanks." the man with the blue baseball cap replied, his grin widening.
1.9.A.jpg; The man with the goatee clutched his can, his eyes darting around nervously.  "Hey Kim!" a voice called out, a hint of urgency in the tone.
1.10.A.jpg; He waved his hand, a look of surprise on his face. "It's been a while." he said.  "Wait, Bak! What are you doing here?"
1.10.B.jpg;  The two men clasped hands, their smiles bright and genuine.  "Didn't you leave because you didn't want to become a hunter?" the man in the blue jacket asked.  "Well, my wife is pregnant with our second son, haha..." the other man replied, a twinkle in his eyes.  
1.10.C.jpg;  The man with the blue jacket grinned broadly, his eyes shining with excitement.  "It's not easy to live life." he mused,  "true, there's nothing like a raid to earn a fortune."
1.11.A.jpg;  He clutched his chest, his face contorted in pain.  "I'm worried." he whispered.  "It's been so long that I might fall behind."
1.11.B.jpg;  Taking a sip from his blue cup, the man let out a sigh of relief.  "Yo-Sung! You arrived!" a voice boomed from behind him.  "Sung, thanks for coming." another voice chimed in. 
1.12.A.jpg;  The three men stood huddled together, the cold air biting at their faces.  "It's cold out there, isn't it?" the man with the brown hair said, patting the man in the blue hoodie on the shoulder.  "Good job." he added, his eyes filled with admiration.  "Haha, it's nothing... I'll be in your hands today too." the man with the dark hair replied, a mischievous glint in his eyes. 
1.12.B.jpg;  The man with the black hair beamed, his smile wide and infectious.  "Yo, Sung! Sung! You eat yet?" a voice called out.  "Yeah, Mr. Kim Sang-shik." he replied.  "Thanks for worrying about me." 
1.13.A.jpg;  His laughter filled the air as he recounted a story to the man in the green jacket.  "Hehehe... you wouldn't know since he came right after you quit." he chuckled.  "His nickname is..." 
1.14.A.jpg;  He slumped against a wall, his shoulders drooping with dejection.  "The world's weakest." a voice whispered, tinged with disbelief.  "The world's weakest? Not the strongest?" another voice echoed, confusion evident.  "Bro, that's what we call S-rank hunters." the first voice explained.  "Sung is considered to be the weakest." 
1.14.B.jpg;  The two men engaged in a heated debate, their voices echoing in the room.  "I mean, he's weak enough to get hurt in an E-rank dungeon..." one man said, his eyes wide with disbelief.  "Yeah, he's probably the weakest of us all." the other man agreed, nodding his head.  "Is he actually the weakest?"  "He's actually that weak?"
1.14.C.jpg;  His ears perked up at the whispers coming from the two men in the background.  "So that means our dungeon will be weak as well since he came." one man said.  "Ah... I see." the other man replied, his tone hushed.  "Hey, he might hear us. Let's end it for now, fu fu..." 
1.15.A.jpg; The man with the dark hair turned, his face neutral.  "Hi, may I have a cup of coffee?" he asked politely, a hint of desperation in his voice.  "I've been hearing you, old geezers... ha..." the man with the blue shirt replied, his grin widening.  "Ah, Hunter Sung Woo-jin. I'm sorry, all the coffee ran out just now..." 
1.16.A.jpg;  He leaned back against a tree, his tired eyes closing momentarily.  "Not even coffee... feels bad, man." he muttered.
1.17.A.jpg;  She gasped, her hand flying to her chest.  "Oh, hi! Looks like Miss Ju-hee is also attending this raid?" a voice called out, a hint of surprise in its tone.  "Of course! But that's not the problem!" she retorted, her eyes narrowed.  "Why is your face hurt again!?"
1.18.A.jpg;  He grinned sheepishly, his bandage a stark reminder of his recent mishap.  "Dunno... it just happened while I was hunting, haha..." he said, trying to brush it off.  "Really... what actually happened?" she questioned.
1.18.B.jpg;  He sat on the wooden box, his shoulders slumping with defeat.  "You even went to a hospital?" she asked, her tone laced with disbelief.  "Yeah..." he mumbled, his eyes downcast. 
1.18.C.jpg;  She stared at him, her eyebrows furrowed in disbelief.  "We were in an E-rank dungeon, and I was the only one hurt." he explained.  "Huh? How could that happen..." she whispered, her shock palpable.
1.19.A.jpg;  He looked up, a blush creeping up his neck.  "The others were all higher ranked so they didn't even bring a healer." he explained. 
1.19.B.jpg;  She shook her head, her frustration mounting.  "Even so, they really didn't bring a healer just because they would be safe?" she questioned.
1.20.A.jpg;  He looked down, his cheeks flushing red.  "It's okay, it's only because I'm weak..." he mumbled.  "I'm used to it, Miss Ju-hee also knows that, right?" he added, trying to lighten the mood. 
1.20.B.jpg;  She pondered for a moment, her eyes gazing at the bustling city around them.  "Well, looks like everyone's getting ready to go into the gate. Let's go as well." she said, rising to her feet.  "Ok..." he replied.
1.21.A.0.jpg; The group stood before the glowing blue portal, their faces filled with anticipation.  "Every-one!" a voice boomed, a wave of excitement washing over the crowd.  "We're off to go happy hunting so I'm not really qualified to say this, but."  a man with a brown beard added, a smile lighting up his face. 
1.21.A.1.jpg;  Standing tall, the man with short brown hair addressed the group.  "I'd like to be the party leader for this raid, is that alright with you people?" he asked.
1.22.A.jpg;  The group nodded in agreement, their faces filled with trust.  "Mr. Song, you're the highest ranked here! I've got no problems." the man with short brown hair said.  "Well, if it's Mr. Song, we can trust him. It's been a while since I've witnessed his skills." the man with curly brown hair added, a hint of excitement in his tone.
1.22.B.jpg;  The group readily agreed to his leadership.  "Yeah, I agree as well." the man in the green jacket said, nodding his head.  "Me too." the woman in the center chimed in.  "Yeah, count me in." the man on the right added, his smile widening.
1.22.C.jpg;  The man with the blue hoodie smiled gratefully, his eyes filled with trust.  "Take care of us, Mr. Song Chi-yul." he said.
1.23.A.jpg;  The group stood poised at the edge of the dungeon, their faces alight with excitement.  "Alright, then let's enter the dungeon." the man with short brown hair declared.  "Let's go!!!" the group shouted in unison, their voices filled with anticipation.
1.24.A.jpg;  The man with short brown hair patted the man with the blue hoodie on the shoulder, his eyes twinkling with amusement.  "Mr. Sung, try not to get injured behind us, okay?" he said.  "Haha... Okay." the man with the blue hoodie replied, a smile spreading across his face.
1.24.B.jpg;  The man with the blue hoodie nodded, his eyes filled with excitement.  "Let's go, Jin-Woo." he said.  "Ok, ok..." the woman replied.
1.24.C.jpg;  He clenched his fists, his face set with determination.  "I'm gonna try my best today!!" he declared.
1.25.A.jpg;  He took a deep breath, his gaze fixed on the swirling blue energy before him.  With a surge of courage, he stepped forward, his heart pounding in his chest.
2.0.A.jpg;  The group stood before the glowing portal, their faces filled with anticipation.  "All clear! Let's go!" a voice boomed, a wave of excitement washing over the crowd.  "Ah, ok." another voice replied, their faces filled with anticipation. 
2.0.B.jpg;  The man with the "KHA" hat smiled warmly at his companion. "What're you thinking about?" he asked. The other man looked down, his brow furrowed in concern.  "It's just... Hunter Sung Jin-Woo... I'm a little bothered that we couldn't give him any coffee."
2.1.A.jpg; The man with the "KHA" hat looked up, his eyes wide with surprise.  "They said it's about D-rank." he exclaimed, a grin spreading across his face.  "I've never seen Hunter Sung Jin-Woo uninjured in my whole time at the Hunter's Guild."
2.2.A.jpg;  The man focused intently on the glowing orb, his expression grim.  "Jin-Woo, why are you so adamant on working as a hunter?" a voice echoed in the air.  "Fighting like this will only bring even more risks!"
2.3.A.jpg;  The woman with orange hair gently laid her hand on the man's shoulder, her smile soft and reassuring.  "Sorry..." he mumbled.  "I'm not saying this for an apology! I'm just worried." she replied, her eyes filled with concern. 
2.4.A.0.jpg;  The man with red hair unleashed a torrent of fiery energy, his face contorted in concentration.  The woman with orange hair watched intently, her bright blue eyes fixed on him.  His power surged around him, a testament to his strength and determination. 
2.4.A.1.jpg;  He swung his sword with fierce determination, his blade slicing through the monster's dark flesh.  The monster roared in pain, its blue streaks pulsing with anger.  The battle raged on, a clash of wills and power.
2.4.B.jpg; The large room was a scene of chaos, the golden ceiling cracked and crumbling.  People fought for their lives, their cries echoing through the broken space.  The man with black hair stood amidst the carnage, his blue jacket a stark contrast to the surrounding chaos.
2.5.A.jpg; The woman with orange hair sighed, her face etched with exhaustion.  "At least this raid is almost over." she thought, a sense of relief washing over her. 
2.6.A.jpg;  She looked at him with worry, her eyes filled with concern.  He met her gaze, his expression serious despite the bandage on his cheek.  The air between them crackled with unspoken emotions.
2.6.B.jpg; He walked away, his shoulders squared, his steps firm.  He glanced back over his shoulder, his gaze determined.  The bandage on his cheek was a reminder of his struggles, but his resolve remained unwavering. 
2.6.C.jpg;  The man with the axe grinned confidently, his eyes gleaming with arrogance.  "Looks like it's done!" he exclaimed.  "Mr. Bak, you're not dead yet, huh?" the other man asked, his frown deepening with concern.  "Ha, this is a piece of cake." Bak replied, his arrogance undiminished.
2.7.A.jpg;  He narrowed his eyes, suspicion flickering across his face.  "Jin-Woo, do you have a reason..." he asked.  His gaze was fixed on something beyond the frame, his mind racing with questions.
2.8.A.jpg;  Her eyes widened in surprise.  "To not quit being a hunter?" she asked.  Her expression was a mixture of shock and intrigue.
2.8.B.jpg;  He threw his head back, a playful grin spreading across his face.  "I'm just a hunter for fun. If I don't do this, I might actually die from boredom!" he exclaimed.  "Telling her personal reasons will make me even more embarrassed..." he thought, his cheeks flushing slightly.
2.8.C.jpg;  She laughed, her amusement bubbling over.  "Looks like having 'fun' two times will send you raiding in the afterlife." she teased, her eyes twinkling with mirth.  "Pfffft - Ack!!" he sputtered, his face contorting in disgust.  "Don't laugh!! You'll open up" she retorted, her laughter echoing in the room. 
2.9.A.0.jpg;  He stared at the object in his hand, his brow furrowed in thought.  "Yeah yeah..." he mumbled.  "This is what you get after killing a monster - the magical core." he explained, his gaze fixed on the object.
2.9.A.1.jpg;  He held the white star-shaped weapon, a smug smile playing on his lips.  His eyes gleamed with self-satisfaction, a hint of deviousness in their depths.
2.10.A.jpg;  The silhouette of the dragon loomed against the blue background, a fearsome reminder of its power.  "A magical core from even a C-rank monster is worth thousands." a voice explained, its tone filled with awe.  "However, since Jin-Woo was an E-rank hunter, C-rank monsters were impossible for him." 
2.10.B.0.jpg; He held the single E-rank magical core in his hand, his face etched with disappointment.  "After all my injuries and troubles, I only earned a single E-rank magical core..." he sighed.  
2.10.B.1.jpg;  He clenched the star-shaped weapon, his expression set with determination.  "Considering I put my life on the line..." he thought, his eyes burning with a newfound resolve. 
2.11.A.jpg;  He stood hunched over, his face etched with worry.  "Earning money like this is..." he murmured.  "Hey! Everyone! There's another entrance here!!" a voice boomed, a wave of excitement rippling through the group. 
2.12.A.jpg;  The group stood at the entrance of the cave, their faces alight with curiosity.  The opening was dark and mysterious, beckoning them with a sense of both excitement and trepidation. 
2.12.B.jpg;  He grinned, his eyes sparkling with excitement.  "The double lair... looks like it's actually real." he exclaimed, his finger pointing towards the cave entrance.  His voice was filled with a mixture of wonder and anticipation.
2.13.A.jpg;  He unleashed a burst of energy, his arm extended, his body glowing with power.  The air crackled with energy, a testament to his strength and control.
2.13.B.jpg; The cave opening shimmered with an otherworldly light, its source shrouded in mystery.  The rocks surrounding it were ancient and weathered, their presence adding to the sense of mystery and power. 
2.14.A.jpg;  She stood in the center of the cave, her arms raised, her figure bathed in light.  The cave walls were dark and textured, a stark contrast to the ethereal glow surrounding her. 
2.14.B.jpg;  He straightened his shoulders, his gaze fixed on the group.  "Hmm... everyone, listen to me for a moment." he said.  His expression was unreadable, a hint of anticipation hanging in the air.
2.16.A.0.jpg;  He looked up, his brow furrowed with curiosity.  "Since the gate is still open, it seems the boss is inside there." he mused.  The group stood on the circular platform, their eyes drawn to the mysterious gate.
2.16.A.1.jpg; He smiled, his right hand raised in a gesture of command.  "Usually, we'd need to contact our guild and await their orders, but..." he began.  The group leaned in, their faces alight with anticipation.
2.16.B.jpg;  The group stood in a tense huddle, their faces filled with a mixture of worry and suspense.  They exchanged nervous glances, their eyes darting around, searching for answers.  The atmosphere was heavy with unspoken apprehension. 
2.16.C.jpg;  He clutched his face, his expression filled with worry.  "If the other hunters get to it first, our profits would dwindle." he whispered.  His eyes darted around, searching for a solution to the impending threat.
2.17.A.jpg;  He stroked his chin, his brow furrowed in thought.  "So I wish for all of us to go kill the boss..." he declared.  His eyes were filled with determination, his resolve unwavering. 
2.17.B.jpg;  The man with black hair addressed the group, his expression serious.  "Since it could be dangerous, why don't 17 of us take a vote?" he suggested.  The group exchanged uneasy glances, the weight of the decision heavy on their shoulders. 
2.18.A.jpg;  He stood on the cliff, his gaze fixed on the ground below.  He raised his hand, his finger pointing towards the distant horizon.  "And no complaining after the vote results." he stated.  His expression was serious, his determination unyielding.
2.18.B.jpg;  The two men engaged in a heated debate, their voices filled with disagreement.  "We vote to fight." the man in the blue jacket declared.  "Nah." the man in the green jacket retorted, shaking his head.  "I vote to go." the man in the blue jacket countered.  "I say no." the man in the green jacket insisted.
2.19.A.jpg;  He stared at her, his eyes wide with surprise.  "It's 8:8 so far, huh?" he exclaimed.  His expression was a mixture of shock and uncertainty. 
2.19.B.jpg; He looked at the group, his face etched with worry.  "How about Mr. Sung?" he asked.  His eyes darted around, searching for an answer to the looming question. 
2.20.A.jpg;  He clenched his fist, his knuckles white with tension.  "On Sung's vote." he said.  "I don't have enough money..." he murmured, his brow furrowed.  "Soon, I even need to send my little sister to college..." he added.
2.20.B.jpg;  The woman lay in the hospital bed, her face pale and drawn.  "And..." a voice whispered, its tone filled with sadness.  "My sick mother..." it continued, the words heavy with unspoken pain.  "For my family!" the voice declared, its strength returning, fueled by love and determination. 
2.21.A.jpg; He shouted.  "I'm going!" he declared, his eyes ablaze with resolve.  His fist clenched tightly, his body tensed, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead. 
3.0.A.jpg;  The group walked cautiously through the dark and rocky terrain, their faces etched with concern.  "Aren't we going too far in?" one of them asked, their voice laced with worry.  "How long did we walk?" another voice chimed in, their curiosity piqued.  "About 40 minutes." someone replied.  "The gate closes in an hour after we kill the boss so we have about 20 minutes left." another voice added, their tone urgent.
3.2.A.jpg;  He walked away, his shoulders slumped, his gaze fixed on the ground.  "Hey... sorry..." he mumbled.  "About what?" she asked. her gaze fixed on something beyond him. 
3.2.B.jpg;  He grinned, his eyes glinting with mischief.  "Forcibly coming here after I voted yes..." he said.  His sly smile hinted at a hidden agenda.
3.2.C.jpg;  She walked away, her back to the viewer.  "I'm fine so you don't need to worry about me." she said, her words masking a deep-seated unease.  Her attempt at strength masked a growing fear.
3.3.A.jpg;  Her eyes blazed with red light, her anger palpable.  "To be honest... no. I am definitely not okay." she spat.  He looked at her with concern, his heart pounding in his chest.
3.4.A.jpg;  She stood before him, her red eyes blazing with fury.  "Are you insane?? Just now if you'd been stabbed a little above, you would've had a hole in your heart!" she screamed.  "And that's not even considering your arms and legs!! Even though I barely healed them!!" she added, her anger bordering on madness. 
3.4.B.jpg;  He hung his head, his face buried in his hands.  "What even made you say yes, huh?? Did you also hurt your head??" she asked.  "Huh?!?." he mumbled.  "Sorry..." he whispered.  "True... I'm only alive because Miss Ju-hee is a B-rank healer. I'm in her debt yet again..." he added. 
3.5.A.0.jpg; She sighed, a thoughtful expression on her face.  "Ah..." she said.  "If you're that sorry... how about treating me to some food?" she suggested, a mischievous glint in her eyes. 
3.5.A.1.jpg; They stood side by side, an awkward silence hanging between them.  He hung his head, his sadness palpable.  She looked away, her gaze fixed on something beyond him.
3.6.A.jpg;  He stared at the speaker, his eyes wide with shock.  His face was pale, his expression a mixture of fear and disbelief.  The image conveyed a sense of anticipation, leaving the viewer wondering what had happened. 
3.6.B.jpg;  He looked at her, his mouth open in shock, his face pale.  "No! No, of course not..." he stammered.  She stood close, her expression a mixture of annoyance and exasperation.  Her eyes narrowed, her gaze fixed on him. 
3.6.C.jpg;  He looked to the side, his eyes wide with surprise.  She stood close, a mischievous glint in her eyes.  "It's here!! The boss room!!" she exclaimed.  Her face was alight with anticipation.
3.7.A.jpg;  The group stood before the double doors, their faces filled with a mixture of wonder and confusion.  "I've never seen a room with this type of door before..." one of them whispered, their voice laced with awe.  "It's strange." another voice chimed in, their curiosity piqued.  
3.8.A.jpg;  He looked at the other man, his face etched with worry.  "Hey... isn't this place dangerous?" he asked.  The other man nodded, his expression mirroring his concern.  "Yeah." he replied. 
3.8.B.jpg;  His hand was open, his fingers spread, his palm facing the viewer.  "Are you going to return empty-handed after coming here?" he asked.  His gaze was fixed on something beyond the frame, his determination unwavering.
3.8.C.jpg;  He stood before the double doors, his hand resting on the wall, his eyes focused on the entrance.  "We could be the first ones to enter this dungeon... those who want to leave can go. I'm going in there alone if I must." he declared.  His expression was determined, his resolve unshakeable. 
3.9.A.jpg; The group stood huddled together, their faces filled with a mixture of curiosity and confusion.  "Well, Mr. Song Chi-Yul's skill is amazing. He's also extremely offensive styled out of the C-rank hunters." one of them said.  "That man, if he wasn't about to go, he could've been in any big guild." another added.  "Since we came here because we trusted Mr. Song, we might as well follow him to the end." the man with black hair said, his face filled with determination. 
3.10.A.jpg; The double doors, adorned with intricate gold accents, slowly creaked open, revealing the unknown beyond.  The anticipation was palpable, a sense of excitement hanging in the air. 
3.10.B.jpg;  The group stood before the open doors, their faces a mix of worry and excitement.  The man in the blue jacket, his hands spread wide, directed them forward.  "Opens easier than I thought it would..." he said.  "Let's go in." he added, his eyes gleaming with excitement.
3.11.A.jpg; The two torches stood tall, their flames flickering in the dark blue background.  Their light cast long shadows, creating an eerie and mysterious atmosphere.  The anticipation was palpable, the air thick with unspoken questions. 
3.11.B.0.jpg; The room was vast and strangely comforting, a large dome of metal taking center stage. It pulsed with a faint, blue light, casting long shadows across the polished floor.
3.11.B.1.jpg; A hush fell over the group as they stood before the towering statue, its blue flames flickering ominously.  "I've never seen a dungeon like this." one of them whispered, their voice trembling slightly.
3.12.A.jpg;  The stone walls seemed to whisper secrets, each flickering blue flame casting dancing shadows along the passage. It had been ages since anyone dared to tread these forgotten halls.
3.12.B.0.jpg; In the dim light, a knight in full armor stood sentinel, his stone form tinged with an unsettling blue glow. The feeling of unease grew stronger with each step.
3.12.B.1.jpg;  The statues were strange, each holding something different, from swords to instruments,  as if frozen in a silent performance. They were unnervingly lifelike.
3.13.A.jpg; "There's quite a lot of them... it feels scary since there's so many." he whispered.  "Stop saying such negative things." she chided, her hand gently resting on his shoulder.
3.13.B.jpg; The giant head loomed over them, its stone visage etched with a solemn expression. "Wow. Look at that! It's huge!" he exclaimed, his awe palpable.
3.14.A.jpg;  The statue of the seated figure was magnificent, a towering testament to an age long past. "Don't think so. It's only a statue after all." he reassured himself, but the unease remained.
3.14.B.jpg;  They scanned the room, searching for any sign of the monsters, but found nothing. "There's nothing that resembles a monster here." one of them declared. 
3.15.A.jpg; The blue magic seal hummed softly on the floor, its intricate patterns pulsating with energy.  "What is this... a magic seal?" someone asked, their voice tinged with a mixture of wonder and caution. 
3.16.A.jpg; A sense of urgency filled the room, a feeling of dread settling in. "Mr. Song! Something's written here! I think you need to come!" the man shouted.
3.16.B.jpg;  The massive winged statue stood in the center of the square, its moss-covered form bathed in the faint blue glow of the floor.  All eyes were fixed on the statue, anticipation heavy in the air.
3.16.C.jpg; A hooded figure scrutinized the moss-covered stone tablet, their brow furrowed in concentration. "This... is it in runic text?" they wondered, a flicker of curiosity crossing their features.
3.17.A.jpg;  They stood before the weathered tablet, its ancient runes speaking of a forgotten past. "Let's see... Carthenon Temple's commandments." one of them read aloud, their voice hushed in reverence.
3.17.B.jpg;  His bandaged face was a stark contrast to the serenity of the words etched above him. "First, worship the lord." it declared, sending a shiver down his spine.
3.18.A.jpg;  "Second, praise the lord." the inscription proclaimed, its words echoing through the chamber.  "H-hey, Jin-Woo..." he stammered.
3.18.B.jpg;  "Th... there... the huge statue..." he sputtered, his eyes widening in disbelief. The shock was palpable, hanging in the air between them.
3.18.C.jpg;  The structure, a grotesque fusion of stone and moss,  had a single, piercing blue eye. "Third, prove your faith." the inscription stated, chillingly matter-of-fact.
3.19.A.jpg;  A sense of unease washed over him, leaving him cold and apprehensive. "Wait!" he whispered, his thoughts racing. "What... this feeling... It got so quiet that the air seems chilly."
3.20.A.jpg;  The inscription spoke of a grim fate, a chilling warning for those who dared to disobey. "Those who do not follow these commandments, will never return alive." the man stated. 
3.20.B.1.jpg; The men stood before the ancient stone wall, its inscription promising secrets long forgotten. "The prophecy of the ancients." it read, the words etched in a language unknown to them. 
3.21.A.jpg; The door slammed shut, sealing them inside the dark room. "What!!! The door just closed!!" one of them exclaimed.
3.22.A.jpg;  "What do we do now?" she yelled, frustration boiling over. "Dammit! Can't stand this anymore!" she fumed, her clenched fist shaking with anger. 
3.22.B.jpg;  "You guys are all spouting nonsense! It was a mistake to even come here!" he roared. 
3.23.A.jpg; "I'm leaving!" he declared, turning away from the arguing men.  "The boss, treasures, whatever! You guys can take it." he spat, his words bitter and filled with resentment.
3.23.B.jpg; He stood before the imposing door, his fists clenched, a mixture of fear and determination etched on his face.  "Good luck!" a voice called out from the shadows, its tone laced with a chilling indifference.
3.24.A.jpg;  "Stop!! Don't put your hands on the handle!!" he screamed.  his eyes wide with panic. 
3.24.B.jpg; The room crackled with energy, white tendrils of power lashing out, black lines of motion blurring across the space. The air vibrated with the force of the clash, echoing in the silent room.
3.25.A.0.jpg; The crimson blade was pulled free with a sickening crunch, blood spurting from the wound.  The air hung heavy with the metallic tang of blood and the stench of violence.
3.25.A.1.jpg; The sword stood tall, a silent testament to the brutality that had taken place.  Blood splattered the wall, a gruesome tableau of the attack. The hand that emerged from the shadows hinted at the presence of another, a chilling reminder of the danger that lurked. 
3.26.A.0.jpg; The blade gleamed menacingly in the dim light of the alley, a crimson stain spreading across its surface.  A gloved hand gripped the weapon, its owner hidden in the shadows, a sinister presence lurking in the night.
3.26.A.1.jpg;  The man struggled to hold the door shut, his face contorted in fear as the hulking creature approached. The creature's heavy footsteps echoed through the alley, a terrifying sound that sent chills down his spine. 
3.27.A.jpg;  The creatures axe, its red and black blade gleaming,  arched through the air,  its power palpable,  its trajectory aimed at an unseen target.  It moved with terrifying speed and force. 
3.27.B.0.jpg;  "Th... that thing moves!!" the young woman gasped, her eyes wide with disbelief.  The young man with black hair looked on in horror,  his face pale with fear. 
3.27.B.1.jpg;  "The hell!!! We have to fight those?!?!" the young woman exclaimed.   The young men stood frozen, their expressions etched with fear and disbelief. 
3.28.A.jpg;  The young man held the woman close, his face a mask of worry.  His eyes darted around, searching for a way out of the danger that surrounded them.  
3.29.A.jpg;  "Wait..." he murmured.  "Th-there... the eye-ball..."  "If that was really true..." the woman whispered.
3.29.B.jpg;  His eyes widened in disbelief, his face contorted in terror.  A wave of fear washed over him, leaving him speechless. 
3.30.A.jpg;  The creature loomed over the battlefield, its single glowing eye piercing through the darkness. Its presence exuded an aura of power, a chilling reminder of the danger that lurked. 
3.30.B.jpg;   "Ah..." he gasped, his eyes wide with horror. The creature's power was palpable,  a chilling presence that filled him with an overwhelming sense of dread. 
4.0.A.0.jpg;  The creature stood amidst the rubble, its cracked face twisted in a silent scream.  "Th--that thing moves!!!" the words echoed in the air, a chilling testament to the fear that gripped them.
4.0.A.1.jpg;  A sense of dread washed over them as they looked upon the monstrosity.  "The hell!! We have to fight those???" one of them whispered.
4.1.A.0.jpg; The room was vast and imposing, a silent testament to an age long past.  The robed figure sat enthroned,  his presence radiating a chilling aura of power. 
4.1.A.1.jpg;  "What was the rank of the one who died just now?" the older man asked.  "D-rank?" the younger man stammered, his face pale with shock.
4.2.A.jpg;  The creature stood tall and imposing, its armor stained with the blood of its victims. "If even he was bad, he still would've been stronger than an E-rank like me." he muttered,  "But in one hit? Wait, wait a second."
4.2.B.jpg;  The two figures stood like sentinels,  their cracked faces a testament to the battles they had fought.  "This dungeon is a D-rank at most." he said. "I've never heard of monsters as strong as them in the likes of D-rank dungeons!"
4.2.C.jpg;   "If all the statues here can move..."  the man with brown hair began.  "They're not statues." the man with black hair whispered, his eyes wide with terror.
4.4.A.0.jpg;   "Don't tell me..." the man with brown hair muttered.   "Even that one...?"  he whispered,  his eyes fixed on the towering figure. 
4.4.A.1.jpg;  The creature loomed over them,  a formidable presence that commanded their attention.  They stared at it in awe and fear,  its power radiating from its very being.
4.4.B.jpg;  The creature was a sight to behold, its massive form dominating the landscape.  Its cracked face and piercing gaze hinted at a power that was both awe-inspiring and terrifying. 
4.5.A.jpg;  His eyes widened in shock,  a wave of fear washing over him.  The bandage on his face seemed to ache, a painful reminder of the danger he had just faced. 
4.5.B.jpg;  The creature stood as a silent sentinel,  its blue-glass form radiating an aura of power and mystery.  It was a formidable presence,  a chilling reminder of the dangers that lurked in the shadows. 
4.6.A.jpg;  He stood alone in the heart of the forest, the towering trees casting long shadows around him.  "This isn't the first time I encountered a near-death experience." he muttered,  "During my first raid, I accidentally broke away from my party and got lost."
4.7.A.jpg;  "I also got hit by an E-rank monster in the back and was hospitalized for weeks." he shouted, pain etched on his face.  The monster lunged forward, its sickle flashing menacingly in the air. 
4.7.B.jpg;  He lay bruised and battered against the brick wall, his body aching with exhaustion.   "I even almost starved to death after being trapped inside a dungeon..." he whispered. 
4.7.C.jpg;  The swords gleamed menacingly in the dim light.  "Others trade their magical cores for better weapons." he said. "To defeat stronger monsters." 
4.9.A.jpg;  She lay in the hospital bed, her face pale and drawn.  "And to earn more treasures." she whispered,  a flicker of hope fading in her eyes.  "I can't do that."
4.9.B.jpg;  He stood in the light blue room, his face etched with worry.  "Always unequipped." he muttered,  "Buying a poor sword would just result in it being destroyed quickly anyways, and having a healer would mean my injuries would be healed given that it's not extremely serious." 
4.9.C.jpg;  "That brat came out injured again." he said. The man in the blue jacket walked away, his shoulders slumped, a sense of shame hanging in the air.
4.10.A.jpg;  "In a mere E-rank dungeon?"  the man in the black jacket asked.  "I feel bad for the healers raiding with him." he continued,  "They have to work twice as hard." 
4.10.B.jpg;  He sat slumped on the bench, his head bowed, his green bag lying forgotten beside him.  "These days, he's called the world's weakest hunter." a voice whispered, its words echoing the man's despair.
4.11.A.jpg;  "Meaning even though he's a hunter, he's useless."  a voice sneered,  its words dripping with sarcasm.  "My shoe's been destroyed..." he muttered,  defeated. "So the first, second..."  he mumbled. 
4.11.B.jpg; The creatures fist slammed into his stomach,  the impact sending a wave of pain through his body.  "All those days where I came out injured, I ignored their sneering remarks."  he thought,  "And inefficiently worked a job that could result in my death."
4.13.A.jpg;  The eye glowed with an unearthly light,  a chilling reminder of the creature's power.   "That I knew very well."  a voice echoed in the depths of his mind.
4.13.B.jpg;   He gritted his teeth, his eyes burning with determination.  The bandage on his cheek seemed to tighten,  a symbol of the battle he was about to wage. 
4.13.C.jpg;  She screamed in frustration,  her face contorted with panic.  "No! No! No!" she cried. 
4.14.A.jpg;  "Everyone! Duck!!!" he yelled.  His eyes darted around, searching for the source of the danger, his face etched with grim determination.
4.15.A.jpg;  The three men stood poised,  tension crackling in the air.  The man with brown hair stared ahead, his expression serious,  while the man in the green jacket  looked around in confusion,  unsure of what was happening. 
4.15.B.jpg;  The ground cracked and buckled,  a blinding yellow light erupting from the center of the explosion.  The power of the blast was undeniable, a terrifying force that could reshape the world. 
4.16.A.0.jpg;  He stood engulfed in the orange glow,  a figure of pure power.  His face was obscured by the light,  but his presence radiated an undeniable sense of strength and excitement. 
4.16.A.1.jpg;  A powerful force erupted from the figure,  a  "BOOM!" shaking the very foundations of the world.  The air crackled with energy,  a chilling reminder of the power unleashed. 
4.17.A.jpg;  The man with orange hair struggled against the relentless force of the man with long dark hair, a "WHOOSH"  marking the speed of the attack. The scene unfolded on a dusty path, the air thick with anticipation. 
4.17.B.jpg;  The robed figure, his face obscured by the pointed hat, unleashed a blast of pure energy, a blinding yellow beam arcing across the battlefield. "POW!" and "BAM!"  sounded as the force of the attack rippled through the air. 
4.18.A.jpg;  The wall crumbled under the onslaught,  "KABOOM!"  echoing through the air.  The yellow beam of light,  "ZING!"  searing through the air, left a trail of destruction in its wake.
4.19.A.jpg;  "Uh oh."  a voice whispered,  a sense of dread settling over the scene.  He stood amidst the swirling smoke, his eyes glowing with a mournful light,  tears streaming down his face.
4.19.B.jpg;  "Wake up!"  someone yelled,  "Hey!"  another voice echoed, their urgency echoing through the air.  The figures scrambled up the cracked wall,  a glowing orange path illuminating their desperate escape. 
4.20.A.jpg;  "Ahhhh!  She screamed, her hand glowing with a blinding light. The man watched, a cold smile on his lips, as she writhed in pain, the scene radiating a chilling sense of horror.  
4.20.B.0.jpg;   "It's not just a few that died..." the man in the green jacket said. "I barely dodged it." he continued,  "If Sung didn't yell out." 
4.20.B.1.jpg;  "Ugh..."  a voice groaned from the ground.  "We could've been wiped out."  the man said, a sense of relief evident in his smile. 
4.22.A.jpg;  "Miss Ju-Hee!"  a voice cried out,  "Miss Ju-Hee!!"  The woman lay on the ground, her hands clutching her head, her eyes closed in pain,  the sound effect bubbles signifying the urgency of the situation. 
4.22.B.jpg; "Don't stand up! Just remain in your position!" he shouted. "If we stand up, it will attack us again!!" he warned,  his eyes scanning the cityscape, searching for any sign of danger.
4.23.A.jpg;  "Mr. Song."  one of the men said,  "Ok."  he nodded,  his expression serious.  In the next panel, a different man with black hair lay injured on the ground, his eyes fixed on the man with brown hair. "Mr. Song Chi-Yul!" he exclaimed. "Miss Ju-Hee can't handle fear that well." he explained, "That's why she can only do basic raids even though she's a B-rank healer." 
4.24.A.jpg;   "But here." the shadowy figure boomed, its voice echoing through the city,  "It doesn't seem basic."  The horns on its head glinted menacingly, its cracked form radiating a chilling aura of power. 
4.24.B.jpg;  "Only those who moved died." one of them said, a hint of disbelief in his voice. "All the people who lived listened to you."  "Oh."  the other man murmured,  his eyes widening in surprise.  
4.24.C.jpg;  "Wait."  he said,  his brow furrowed in thought.  "Didn't you yell because you knew what would happen?"  His voice was laced with a mix of fear and curiosity, his mind racing to comprehend the events unfolding before him.
4.25.A.0.jpg; "Huh?!"  the man exclaimed, his eye wide with shock.  "Sir, your arm!" he cried. 
4.25.A.1.jpg;  He stood, his face pale but resolute, blood staining his blue jacket.  "I'll be fine."  he said,  "Just help me stop the bleeding, will ya?" 
4.25.B.jpg;   "Sung."  the man in the black jacket asked,  "What rank does that look like to you?"  "Don't know."  Sung replied,  "I've never been into a raid higher than a D-rank." 
4.26.A.jpg;  "I've only experienced a B-rank raid once or twice."  he said. "I can definitely say that this place exceeds that of a B-rank dungeon..."
4.26.B.jpg;  The icy figure sat upon its throne,  a chilling presence that filled the air with a sense of awe and terror.  "Even there."  the man whispered,  "There weren't any monsters of this caliber." 
4.27.A.jpg;  "That one is A-rank." he muttered, beads of sweat forming on his brow.  His eyes darted around, searching for any sign of escape, his heart pounding with fear. 
4.27.B.jpg;  "No...  Maybe an S-rank." he whispered.  "Just now there was the Carthenon Temple's commandments." he murmured,  his gaze fixed on the imposing statue.  
4.28.A.0.jpg;  "First, worship the lord."  the cloaked figure murmured,  its voice echoing through the chamber.  "Second, praise the lord." the inscription declared,  its words etched into the ancient stone.
4.28.A.1.jpg;  "Third, prove your faith." the tablet proclaimed, its words chillingly matter-of-fact.  "Those who do not follow these commandments, will never return alive."  it warned,  its message resonating with an ominous finality.
4.28.B.jpg;  "Mr. Song." he gasped, his face pale,  "The lord..."  The three sat in the wreckage,  the weight of their discovery heavy upon their shoulders. 
4.29.A.jpg;   The creature, its eyes glowing with a malevolent light,  stood before the woman, its presence radiating a menacing aura.  Her eyes narrowed,  her expression grim,  a silent challenge passing between them.
4.30.A.jpg;   The creature, its horns sharp and its eyes glowing,  lurked in the shadows,  its presence a chilling reminder of the dangers that lurked in this world. 
4.31.A.0.jpg;  The creature sat upon its throne,  its mossy hand resting upon the armrest, a terrifying symbol of its power.  The shadows around it seemed to writhe with an unseen energy,  a chilling reminder of its might. 
4.31.A.1.jpg;  He sat in the darkness, his gaze fixed on something unseen,  his mind racing with thoughts and possibilities.  The air hung heavy with a sense of anticipation,  a feeling that something momentous was about to unfold. 
4.32.A.jpg;  "Killing all of them would also take too much time." the man with brown hair said.  The young man with black hair nodded, his eyes fixed on the man,  his face etched with a grim determination. 
5.0.A.jpg; A deep blue gate, swirling with smoke, rotated slowly in the center of the image. Its white core pulsed with an unknown energy, radiating an ominous feeling.
5.0.B.jpg; The tunnel that connected the other world to ours was a large bright blue circle, surrounded by a dark blue nebula. Its white stars twinkled ominously, creating a sense of mystery and fear.
5.1.A.jpg; Ten years ago, a blue circle appeared in the sky, casting an unsettling glow over the city. The once vibrant city now felt bleak and ominous, as if a dark cloud had settled over everything.
5.2.A.jpg; The man with black hair stared intently at someone off-screen, his expression serious and concerned. The three men behind him seemed tense, as if they were discussing a grave situation.
5.2.B.jpg; "I too, became a hunter, but my strength was only enough for an E-rank." the man said, disappointment etched across his face. "Their strength stays the same from when they were awakened - it never changes."
5.3.A.jpg; "Although I am stronger than most humans, the difference between other ranks and me was vast." the man muttered, his face filled with shock and surprise. 
5.3.B.jpg; The red monster with horns roared, its sharp teeth bared in a terrifying snarl.  The three characters scrambled away in terror, their faces pale with fear. "And did this as their career were called 'hunters'." they gasped. 
5.4.A.jpg; The hand, covered in a blue substance and speckled with green, pulsed with an ominous power, creating a sense of mystery and suspense. 
5.4.B.jpg; The man, wearing a grey jacket, stood with his back to the viewer, his face etched with concern. "Despairing." he thought, "Insane monster that springs out of nowhere."
5.5.A.jpg; The man, his face filled with terror, stood frozen, his eyes wide with fear. The monster's massive hand, emerging from the darkness, filled the image, creating a terrifying sense of dread. 
5.5.B.jpg; "There's nothing we can do now, is there?" the man with brown hair asked. "Will you be fine? The bleeding's not stopping." the man with black hair responded, his face covered in bandages. 
5.6.A.jpg; "I brought only three healers because I thought this would be over quickly..." the man said, a mischievous grin spreading across his face as he wiped sweat from his brow.
5.7.A.jpg;  The three characters stood on the edge of the pool, their eyes wide with shock as they stared at the large, cracked wall. "One got attacked so brutally that not even his corpse remained." one of them whispered.
5.7.B.jpg; The man sat on the rock, his back to the viewer, his face filled with worry and fear. "One is so shocked that he's acting like that." he thought. "Save me... save me... I want to live..."
5.7.C.jpg; The man with brown hair cried, his face twisted with distress. "Even a B-rank healer like Ju-Hee probably never experienced anything like this before." he sobbed. "Heh, that's why receiving healing may be a little hard for now."
5.8.A.jpg;  The stone-like creature stood stoic, its serious expression radiating a sense of power. "I think it would be better to just stay still against the likes of him." it said, its voice low and rumbling.
5.9.A.jpg;  The two men stood side by side, their faces etched with worry. "When the situation clears a bit, let's try running then." the man with brown hair said. "Although it won't be easy..."
5.9.B.jpg;  The four characters sat huddled together, their faces filled with despair.  "Hu-hu-huuuuk..." the man with green hair sobbed, his face buried in his hands. "Why do we have to..." he whimpered. "This is only a D-rank dungeon... only a D-rank..." the man with black hair muttered.
5.10.A.0.jpg; The man with black hair and a bandage over his mouth stared intently at something off-screen, his face serious. "Just like what Mr. Song Chi-Yul said, we'll get attacked if we move." he said.
5.10.A.1.jpg; The man with the mischievous grin stared out at the guard statue. "Even if we somehow bypass him, we still have to go through the guard statue." he said. "He probably never intended for us to leave!" 
5.10.B.jpg;  "I won't die like this." the man in mid-air shouted. The two men clashed, their movements blurring as they fought with fierce intensity.
5.12.A.0.jpg; "I finally joined a big guild." the man exclaimed, his face beaming with joy as he stood in the midst of the destruction. His voice was filled with a sense of accomplishment and relief.
5.12.A.1.jpg;  "So I can't die here." the man growled, his face hardening with determination as he clenched his fists. The environment around him was a testament to the fierce battle he had just endured.
5.12.B.jpg;  The man's eyes burned with intense anger and determination, his jaw clenched tightly. His face was a mask of pure resolve, reflecting the fierce battles he had endured.
5.13.A.0.jpg;  "Doing! Don't move!!!" the man with the red jacket yelled. The man with the black hoodie grinned, his eyes gleaming with determination.  "Yeah! I can do it!"
5.13.A.1.jpg;  "If anything, I'm confident in my own speed." the man boasted, his face radiating confidence as he raced forward.  His movements were fluid and effortless, reflecting his incredible speed.
5.14.A.jpg;  "I'll go through the door in an instant!!" the man declared, his silhouette a blur of motion as he hurtled through the air.  His speed was unmatched, leaving a trail of wind in his wake. 
5.14.B.jpg;  Dark gray rocks plummeted from the sky, crashing into the ground below. The blue sky above was a stark contrast to the chaos unfolding beneath, emphasizing the speed and force of the falling debris.
5.15.A.0.jpg; The man with black hair soared through the air, his movement a blur of motion as he raced towards the doorway. The darkness around him seemed to amplify his speed, creating a sense of urgency and power. 
5.15.A.1.jpg;  The man lay unconscious, his body sprawled on the ground.  The destruction surrounding him was a testament to the grueling battle he had just endured. A large double door stood in the background, a reminder of his goal and the obstacles he had overcome. 
5.16.A.jpg; The man with short black hair clenched his jaw, his eyes burning with determination.  He was ready for whatever challenge lay ahead, his anger and focus fueling his eagerness.
5.17.A.jpg; A giant glowing eye, cracked and pulsating with power, stared out into the distance. Its intensity radiated a sense of fear, reminding everyone of the immense power it possessed.
5.17.B.jpg; The man with short black hair gasped in surprise as a red slash appeared behind them.  "Kyaa!" he shouted, pointing at the man with blonde hair.
5.18.A.jpg;  The man ran desperately, his legs pumping as fast as they could. The orange sunset cast long shadows, emphasizing the urgency and danger of his situation.
5.19.A.jpg; The man, cloaked in a long white robe, sat in his chair, his skull-like face radiating power.  Beams of light surrounded him, illuminating his imposing presence and creating an aura of awe and fear.
5.19.B.jpg; The woman with long blue hair stared in horror, her eyes wide with shock. "Kyaa!" she screamed.  
5.20.A.jpg;  The man stared down at the ground, his face etched with surprise. The woman, her face hardened with determination, slammed her fist into the ground, unleashing a powerful force. "Fuck!" she shouted, her anger palpable.
5.20.B.jpg;  The man's face hardened with determination, his eyes filled with fear. "These guys can kill us whenever they feel like it, can't they...?" he muttered.
5.21.A.jpg;  The man's face was twisted with arrogance and malice. "It would be easier than squashing a bug." he said.
5.21.B.jpg;  The man with short blonde hair stared in confusion, his face filled with apprehension.  "They could wipe out all of us this instant..." he said.  The woman with short black hair nodded, her expression determined. "So why aren't they?"  The man shrugged. "Dunno..." 
5.21.C.jpg; The man, trapped in an icy cage, looked anxious and concerned. "It's different from the monsters." he thought, "Even if it could, it does not kill." 
5.23.A.0.jpg; The guard statue, positioned near the door, held its weapon menacingly.  Its dark armor and blue base radiated a sense of anticipation and danger. 
5.23.A.1.jpg; The large ice statue, cracked and weeping, stood guard, its blue base reflecting the ominous atmosphere. "The large statue that shoots beams when you move." he thought, a sense of fear and anxiety creeping into his heart. 
5.23.B.jpg; The man, his blue eyes focused on the statue, stood poised and ready. "They attack in a pattern!" he thought, his mind racing as he strategized his next move.
5.24.A.jpg;  The man, his eyes wide with shock, stared at the statue, his face pale with surprise.  "There's a rule in this room?!" he exclaimed. "A pattern...?" he muttered, his mind struggling to grasp the situation. "It can't be..."
5.25.A.jpg; The two men watched in amazement as the figure with green wings, holding a scroll, soared through the air, its movement a blur. The image, blurred to give a sense of speed, captured the awe and surprise of the moment.
5.25.B.jpg; The figure, cloaked in a blue robe, held the large stone tablet, its inscription hidden from view.  "The commandments of Carthenon!!" the man whispered.  The stone tablet, radiating an aura of power and mystery, seemed to pulse with an ancient energy. 
5.26.A.jpg; The man, his face beaming with excitement, stared at the statue, his eyes wide with surprise.  "Yes! That's it!!!" he shouted.
5.27.A.jpg; The man, his face contorted in surprise, stared at the statue, his mouth agape. "Commandment?" he gasped. "Mr. Song Chi-Yul! What was the first commandment??" he shouted. 
5.27.B.jpg; The man with brown hair, his brow furrowed in contemplation, pondered the question. "Worship the Lord?" he murmured. "The first would be..." 
5.28.A.jpg; The blue-skinned man with the crown, his red eyes filled with worry, stared out at the dungeon. "The Lord, huh..." he muttered.
5.28.B.jpg; The man with brown hair, his face contorted in surprise, stumbled back as the man with black hair, kneeling, yelled, "Sir, there's a rule in this dungeon! What are you doing?"
5.29.A.jpg;  "If I'm correct..." the man with brown hair said.  "Are you crazy?" he shouted, his eyes wide with astonishment.
5.29.B.jpg; The two men stared at each other, their faces filled with confusion.  Neither of them understood what was happening, their expressions a mix of bewilderment and apprehension. 
5.30.A.jpg; The man with brown hair, his face etched with confusion, stood before the statue-like figure on the throne.  "He doesn't attack those who move." he thought.
6.0.A.jpg; The man, his face calm and thoughtful, stood in the dungeon, his gaze fixed on the ground. His blue jacket seemed to blend with the blue background, creating a sense of serenity in the midst of the chaos.
6.1.A.jpg; The man with black hair, his face etched with confusion, looked around frantically. His dark shirt stood out against the blue background, highlighting his bewilderment and uncertainty.
6.1.B.jpg; The man with brown hair, his light blue face serious, stared intently at the statue. "Those eyes aren't the eyes of a man who wishes to die." he said. 
6.1.C.jpg; The man with brown hair, his face filled with confusion, stood before the statue-like figure on the throne. The figure, its gaze fixed downward, seemed to exude an air of ancient power. 
6.2.A.jpg; The man, his face contorted in pain and rage, yelled.  His wide eyes reflected the intensity of his emotions, his dark outfit blending with the blue background, amplifying the sense of distress. 
6.2.B.jpg; The man, his body hunched over, his arms extended,  looked down at the tiled floor, his face etched with pain.  His hooded jacket shadowed his features, highlighting his anguish.
6.3.A.jpg; The man, his face contorted in fury,  shouted.  His clenched jaw and gritted teeth spoke volumes about his anger, his blue shirt contrasting with the blue background, drawing attention to his intense emotions. 
6.3.B.jpg; The man, his jaw clenched tightly,  looked down, his face determined and focused. "He starts to attack if you move past a certain height." he said. 
6.4.A.jpg; The man's eyes widened in surprise, his face pale with shock.  "I finally understand the meaning of the first commandment!" he exclaimed. 
6.4.B.jpg; The man, his face grim and serious,  yelled.  "Everyone!!! Bow down to the statue!!!" he commanded, his tone demanding obedience. 
6.4.C.jpg; The two men, their faces flushed with anger, argued fiercely. "Sung Jin-Woo, have you gone mad?!" the man with black hair shouted.  "What are you talking about?!" the man with brown hair yelled back.  "Huh?" he added, his expression a mixture of confusion and anger.
6.5.A.jpg;  The man, his eyebrows raised, smirked at the reader, his eyes glinting with amusement. "You figured something out, right?" he said. 
6.5.B.jpg; The man, his face set in a determined expression, looked at the reader, his jaw clenched tightly. "Yes." he said. 
6.6.A.jpg;  The man, his face contorted in pain and distress, looked down at the statue. "He attacks if you move past a certain height, and therefore doesn't attack when you bow down low enough." he said. "Worship the Lord", means to literally bow down and worship him." he added. 
6.6.B.jpg; The man, his head bowed, his body tense,  gritted his teeth,  his face contorted in  intense focus. "So when you bow down to him..." he thought. 
6.6.C.jpg; The older man, his face etched with suspicion, narrowed his eyes,  his gaze fixed on something outside the frame.  "This didn't come from just a gut feeling, right?" he said.

10.4.A.0.jpg; The man's eyes widened in alarm. "Mr. Song Chi-Yul?!" he exclaimed. "The door won't close fully as long as there's at least one person on the altar, right?" 
10.4.A.1.jpg; "You two have many more years left ahead of you... you should leave." the man with long brown hair urged.

10.9.A.jpg; The man looked at the woman, his expression filled with worry.  "Mister, you should take Miss Ju-hee out of here."
10.9.B.0.jpg; The armored figures marched forward, their faces set in grim determination. "I said I would stay!" one of them roared. 
10.9.B.1.jpg; "Then who will help Miss Ju-hee out of here?"  one of the figures demanded. "There's no time! Go!!"
10.10.A.jpg; The man sat alone, his brow furrowed in deep thought. He looked troubled, his mind racing.
10.10.B.jpg;  "No! Jin-Woo..." she cried. "I'd rather stay..." 
10.10.C.jpg; The man sat with a confident smile. "I promised to buy you dinner, didn't I?"
10.11.A.jpg; The woman cried, her face contorted with anguish.  "Eat it first." a voice urged, its tone firm and unwavering. 
10.11.B.jpg;  "I'll get my payment from you when I return." she vowed. 
10.12.A.jpg;  "This isn't the time for jokes-"  she cried. 
10.12.B.jpg;  The man looked away, his face etched with sadness.  "...sorry, but there really isn't any time left."
10.13.A.jpg;  The woman smiled, her red eyes sparkling with relief.  "Please, take care of her."  The man smiled back, his face crinkled with kindness. "Yeah, I will."

10.15.A.0.jpg;  The man stood poised, his weapon held at the ready. The shadows danced around him, creating an unsettling atmosphere.
10.15.A.1.jpg; The man slumped in defeat, his gaze fixed on the floor.  "I would've at least gotten an insurance if I had known this would happen..." he muttered bitterly.

10.16.B.0.jpg; A hand, slick with blood, protruded from the wall. "Haa." a gasp escaped, a chilling testament to the horror of the scene.
10.16.B.1.jpg;  He lay on the floor, his red eyes blazing with anger. "Haa." he snarled. "Since it has come down to this, I'm gonna take at least one monster with me!" "Huk." he coughed, a sound that spoke volumes of the pain he endured. 
10.17.A.jpg; He sat amidst the carnage, his body a canvas of blood. "Huk." he groaned, his face contorted in agony.  
10.18.A.jpg; Three towering figures stood before the small figure, their armor radiating a menacing aura. The small figure sat in the orange glow, his sword clutched tightly in his hands, a sense of impending doom hanging in the air.

10.24.B.jpg;  He lay still, his body a canvas of blood.  "Huu..." a sigh escaped his lips. "Huuuu..."  his breathing shallow and strained. "I don't wanna..."  his voice a mere whisper. 
10.25.A.jpg; Blood poured from his mouth, his eyes filled with terror.  "Don't wanna die." he choked out. "I don't wanna die!!" 
10.26.A.jpg; He stood, his anger burning like the flames behind him.  "Of course it's not 'fine'." he growled. "What do you mean, 'thankful'!"
10.26.B.jpg; Tears streamed down his face.  "Quit it with all these betrayals!" he cried.  "I have a family too..."
10.27.A.jpg;  "I don't wanna die either!!!" he screamed, his fear palpable. 
10.27.B.jpg; The woman glared at the ground. "Glad for being the only one dying here? Stop lying to yourself!"
10.27.C.jpg; The armored man stood frozen, fear etched into his face.  "I... don't wanna die.." he whimpered. 
10.28.A.0.jpg; His eye, wide with pain, was filled with a desperate plea.  "If only I had..." he whispered, his words choked with agony.

11.5.A.0.jpg;  The man's eyes widened in surprise as the suited figure approached, holding out a business card.  "The Korean Hunter Guild's inspectors..." the words echoed in a bubble below him. "I'm sorry if we surprised you." the suited figure said.
11.5.A.1.jpg; He stared at the business card, confusion clouding his features.  "Why do the inspectors want to see me..." he whispered, a wave of apprehension washing over him. 
11.6.A.jpg;  He stared in disbelief, his mouth agape. "I was asleep for three days?!" he exclaimed.
11.6.B.jpg;  The blonde man stood beside the bed, his eyes filled with concern. "What happened to Miss Ju-Hee and Mr. Song Chi-Yul?" he asked.  "Are they safe?" she whispered. "Yes, they're safe, but..." he hesitated, his words leaving a trail of suspense. 
11.7.A.0.jpg;  The man's face was etched with worry, his bandaged arm a stark reminder of the tragedy.  "Hunter Song Chi-Yul's missing arm will most likely impede his work from now on." he said. "He may retire if he chooses to."
11.7.A.1.jpg;  She sat on the bed, her eyes downcast, her face mirroring the pain that gripped her.  "Hunter Lee Ju-Hee is still getting treated due to her extreme trauma." he stated.
11.9.A.jpg;  He sat on the couch, his brow furrowed in thought.  "It's uncertain if they will stay as hunters." he said.  "And other hunters like Kim Sang-Shik..." he trailed off, a somber expression settling on his face. "No..." he whispered. "It's fine, that's enough."
11.9.B.jpg;  He looked down, his eyes filled with sorrow, his heart heavy with despair.  The man in the suit ran from the door, his face contorted with fear, while another man cried, a sword clutched in his hand, a silent testament to the tragedy that had unfolded.
11.10.A.jpg;  He sat on the couch, his face a mask of concern, his eyes reflecting the weight of the loss.  "The number of people that survived the double lair is six." he announced.  "Although hunters are in danger every time they hunt, it's rare for a massacre like this to occur."
11.10.B.0.jpg;  The two men stood at the cave entrance, their faces etched with sadness, their eyes fixed on the plate on the pedestal.  "When the inspectors and the White Tiger Guild reached the scene..." one of them muttered.
11.10.B.1.jpg;  He lay on the stone platform, his eyes wide with shock, his face reflecting the horror of the discovery.  "They were all gone." he whispered, the words hanging in the air, heavy with the weight of the tragedy. 
11.12.A.jpg;  She stared at him, her mouth agape, her eyes wide with disbelief.  "Was only you, lying on the altar..." she gasped.  "No statues or anything the others described were found." she added.  "That can't be..." she whispered, her words barely audible.  "We couldn't believe it either." he admitted.
11.12.B.jpg;  He leaned forward, his brow furrowed with suspicion.  "This is just our theory, but..." he said.
11.13.A.jpg;  He stared intently, his eyes narrowed with suspicion.  "We believe you have received the 'double awakening'." he stated.
11.13.B.jpg;  His jaw clenched, his eyes wide with worry. "Double awakening?!" he exclaimed.
11.13.C.jpg;  He roared. his body radiating white lines of energy.  "A hunter's stats are set when they receive the 'awakening', or power." he explained. 
11.14.A.jpg;  The words on the screen flashed before him, a sense of surprise and confusion washing over him.  "However, some hunters get awakened again after the first time." the text read.  "There have been cases of C-ranks plowing directly to an A-rank, or a B-rank shooting straight to S-rank."
11.15.A.jpg;  He placed his hand on the gold and purple object, a spark of intrigue and interest flickering in his eyes.  "This is the magic power detector." the text above read.  "All you have to do is place your hand on the mana crystal." the text below instructed.
11.15.B.0.jpg; He looked ahead, his brow furrowed with concern. "If there actually were such death-level monsters described by the survivors, normal hunters wouldn't cut it." the text above read.  "Only by gathering A-ranks and S-ranks could the situation have been resolved." the text below explained.
11.15.B.1.jpg;  He stared ahead, his face etched with disbelief.  "But all those monsters just disappeared..." the text below him stated. 
11.16.A.jpg;  He examined the black device in his hand, his face a mask of worry.  "It's impossible to not suspect the possibility of Hunter Sung Jin-Woo receiving a double awakening." the text below read, "seeing that he was the only survivor left inside."
11.17.A.0.jpg;  He stared at the device, his face reflecting a mixture of disappointment and frustration.  "However..." the text above read.  "I guess trash is trash, through and through." the second text declared.  "Even the lowest E-rank is at least a 70..." the final text stated. 
11.17.A.1.jpg;  He stared at the device in his hand, a mixture of relief and surprise washing over him.  "It looks like we suspected you for no reason." the text below confirmed, easing his worries.
11.17.B.jpg;  He watched the two men in black suits walk away, his brow furrowed with confusion.  "Damn... nothing, huh?" he muttered.
11.18.A.jpg; He looked around, his eyes wide with concern.  "But aren't those people aware of that?" he thought.
11.18.B.jpg;  He lay in bed, his eyes fixed on the ceiling, his thoughts swirling in his mind.  "Could it be that they can't see it?" he wondered, a sense of bewilderment creeping into his voice.  "Message - You have unread mail." the message above him flashed, momentarily interrupting his thoughts.
11.19.A.jpg;  The foot, tucked under the blanket, peeked out from beneath the covers.  A sense of mystery and intrigue hung in the air, the man's hidden form fueling speculation.
11.19.B.jpg;  He sat, his hands clasped over his heart, a sense of calmness radiating from him.  "Still there." the words above him seemed to reassure him, a quiet comfort in the midst of uncertainty.
11.20.A.jpg;  He pointed his finger, his face contorted with confusion.  "Should I have told them?" he wondered.  "That I can see this..." he added, his thoughts racing.  "Guess it's not a touch screen." he muttered, his hand hovering over the air.  "Was reality..." he trailed off, his mind grappling with the extraordinary. 
11.20.B.jpg;  He leaped over the bed, his playful mood evident in his movements.  "Brother, what are you doing?" a voice called out, the words echoing in the bedroom.
11.21.A.0.jpg;  She stood at the door, her face etched with concern, a book bag slung over her shoulder.  "Your head's not hurt as well, is it?" she asked.
11.21.A.1.jpg; Her feet, clad in white socks and sneakers, stood firmly on the tiled floor.  A sense of calm and relaxation emanated from her, a stark contrast to the anxieties that had plagued her earlier. 
11.21.B.jpg;  She glared at him. "Didn't I tell you to stop getting injured?" she demanded, her frustration evident.  "Do you know how worried I was?!" he exclaimed.  "...Sorry." he mumbled, his words barely audible.
11.22.A.jpg;  He stood beside her, his brow furrowed with worry, his eyes reflecting a sense of deep concern.  "The others all return fine, so why are you always the only one getting injured!" she exclaimed.  "Can't believe I almost left her behind." he whispered, his words laced with a hint of self-reproach.
11.22.B.jpg;  She stared at him, her face contorted with anger. "If you get hurt one more time, I'm gonna throw away studying and work instead, so you can quit being a hunter!" she declared, her words carrying the weight of her frustration.  The man, injured and bleeding, looked at her, his expression a mixture of pain and resignation.
11.23.A.jpg;  The woman on the left looked concerned, her brow furrowed with worry.  "Jin-ah, can you see this?" the woman on the right asked.  The man in the background, his face hidden in shadow, appeared to be in shock.  "You have unreal..." the text in front of him read, his eyes wide with disbelief.
11.23.B.jpg;  She stared at him, her face filled with frustration.  "How would you read it?" she asked.  "You really didn't hurt your head, right?" she added.
11.24.A.jpg;  He glanced at the screen, his eyes widening in surprise.  "Open the mailbox?" he muttered.  The screen displayed the message, "Welcome, [Player] Unread Daily Quest: Preparing to Become Strong has arrived unread."
11.25.A.jpg;  She smiled, her eyes sparkling with excitement.  "I'll be going for now." she said.  "Let's go." she added, her words echoing the shared excitement of the moment. 
11.26.A.jpg;  He looked at the screen, his brow furrowed with confusion.  "I can't understand what they're saying." he muttered.  The screen displayed the message, "Alarm [Your rewards have arrived]." but the accompanying cards were written in a language he couldn't comprehend. 
11.26.B.jpg;  He stood in the neon-lit space, his thoughts swirling with a sense of mystery and intrigue.  "Now that I think about it, I remember seeing something similar when I was left on the altar..." he mused.  The screen, flashing with the words "Alarm" and "[You have completed all the necessary requirements of the secret quest]." only deepened his curiosity.
11.27.A.jpg;  The shadowy figures stood in the darkness, their green eyes piercing the gloom.  A sense of mystery and fear hung heavy in the air, their presence shrouded in an unsettling silence.

11.29.B.jpg; He looked up, a smile playing on his lips, his face a mixture of amusement and confusion.  "Haha... what is this..." he chuckled, shaking his head.  "This is a joke, right?" he asked.
11.29.C.jpg; He lay on the ground, his body weary, his face reflecting the exhaustion of his condition.  "Someone hospitalized doesn't even have the strength to do this." the text above him read, highlighting the absurdity of the situation. 
11.31.A.jpg;  He raised his hand, his fingers outstretched in a questioning gesture. "I'll check what this is." he muttered.  "After I sleep..." he added, his body yearning for rest.

12.5.A.jpg;  He screamed, his face contorted with a mixture of anger and desperation. The intensity of his emotion was palpable, his eyes reflecting the urgency of the situation. 
12.6.A.0.jpg; He had finally completed the 'penalty' quest. The man was laying on the floor, legs up against the wall,  feeling the relief of a job well done.
12.6.A.1.jpg;  His body ached, the weight of the recent battle still heavy, he tried to rise from the ground, reaching for a nearby bed.  
12.7.A.jpg;  With a groan, he collapsed onto the floor, hands and knees shaking from exhaustion. The text above him read, "alarm, you have completed the 'penalty' quest." 
12.7.B.jpg;  He stared at the text above him, his face contorted in a mix of anger and confusion. "Penalty quest?" he muttered under his breath. 
12.9.A.jpg;  Her eyes widened in horror, her head tilting to the side. "Oh my gosh! What happened here?!" she cried out.  "Someone come and help, please!"
12.10.A.jpg;  She gasped, her eyes wide with concern as she saw the unconscious man on the floor.  The sand that covered the room was evidence of the recent struggle. 
12.11.A.jpg;  "You know a patient named Sung Jin-Woo?" the woman asked. "I heard that he's a hunter." she continued.
12.11.B.jpg;  "The doctor said that hunters heal faster than normal people, so light exercise should be fine." she said, surprised.  "Look, he's even running right now." 
12.12.A.jpg;  He looked determined, sweat dripping down his face. "If it's light exercise." he thought, "it's really okay, right?" 
12.12.B.jpg;  He was moving with purpose, each step strong and deliberate.  "How many hours has he been running?" someone asked.  "It's been four days since I woke up." he said, "and there are a few things that I found out." 
12.14.A.jpg;  "First." he said. "this thing in front of my eyes is not an illusion."  An alarm sounded, and the message "Running 10km: complete 10/10km"  appeared before him.
12.15.A.jpg;  The man looked at the quest rewards, his eyes settling on the first option: "status recovery."  He smiled, pressing the "accept" button with a feeling of relief. 
12.15.B.jpg;  A blinding light engulfed him, the air thick with the smell of ozone.  He was in the middle of an explosion, terror gripping his heart.
12.16.A.jpg;  The explosion was followed by a wave of energy that left him stunned.  "Magic that can heal your fatigue after exercising." he thought, "the fatigue that nested in my whole body actually disappears as if it wasn't even there in the first place."
12.16.B.0.jpg;  A blue box materialized in his hand, the word "alarm" clearly visible. He was overjoyed, a grin spreading across his face.  "Aside from that, there are also stat points and the random box items." he noted,  "You can increase any one of your character stats at will as long as you have stat points." 
12.16.B.1.jpg;  The blue box displayed his stats:  "Name: Sung Jin-Woo." it read,  "Job: None."  "Title: None."  "HP: 100." "MP: 10." "Strength: 16."  "I get stronger as I increase my character stats." he thought,  "Of course, increasing levels would do the same." 
12.17.A.jpg;  He stared at the menu in disbelief.  "Status, Skills, Items, Inventory, Item Storage." it read.  "It's like a game." he muttered, his mind racing with possibilities. 
12.17.B.jpg;  He sat on the bench, clutching his knee, pain radiating through his body.  "Being controlled by some strange phenomenon..." he thought, struggling to understand what was happening.
12.18.A.jpg;  He relaxed on the bench, a confused expression on his face. "Status." he thought, "Name: Sung Jin-Woo. Job: None."  "Haha, what's actually happening here." he laughed, unsure of what to make of this situation.  
12.18.B.jpg;  The blue box displayed a pixelated image of a man, the words "Sung Jin-Woo." "Job: None." "Title: None." "HP: 100." "MP: 10." "Strength: 16."  "Vitality: 10." "Agility: 10." "Intelligence: 10." "Sense: 10." "Remaining Points: 3." "Level: 1." "Fatigue: 0." all clearly visible. 
12.19.A.jpg; The office building lobby was quiet, the only sound the gentle hum of the elevator. The man walked towards the counter, a sense of normalcy in the air.
12.19.B.jpg;  "Can I take a leave for today?" he asked the woman at the counter. The woman nodded, acknowledging his request.
12.20.A.jpg; "It's fine, but where are you going?" the woman asked, concern etched on her face. He smiled, "I have to take care of some business outside." 
12.20.B.jpg;  The city was bustling with life, but the man walked with a quiet determination, the two female characters trailing behind him. The sign above them read "Hapjung 3." 
12.21.A.0.jpg;  He held the small golden key, its cross gleaming in the sunlight.  "It's time to figure out what this does." he thought, curiosity piqued.
12.21.A.1.jpg;  "The random box that comes out every time I clear the daily quest." he said, a hint of surprise in his voice. "Although sometimes useless items like bandages and pens come out, this seems different."
12.22.A.jpg;  He stared at the key, a sense of astonishment washing over him. "A key that can open instant dungeons..." he muttered, barely able to comprehend the implications. 
12.22.B.jpg;  He looked thoughtfully at the key, a multitude of questions swirling in his mind. "Quests, the status window, rewards." he mused, "Could it be that all of this is because of the double awakening?"
12.23.A.jpg;  He walked down the steps, his head downcast. "The world's weakest receiving a double awakening, huh..." he sighed, "Other people would laugh if they heard."
12.23.B.jpg;  He stood tall, confidence radiating from his very being.  "I'm confident in my ability to run." he said, "So if it becomes too dangerous like last time, I'll run away no matter what." 
12.25.A.jpg;  The key pulsed with magical energy, a blue circle radiating from its center.  A sense of power and mystery filled the air. 
12.25.B.0.jpg; The staircase shimmered with blue lightning, each step crackling with energy.  It was a sight both beautiful and terrifying.

12.28.A.jpg;  He looked to the right, his eyes widening in surprise.  A bright blue light emanated from the center of the room, causing cracks to spiderweb across the floor.
12.28.B.jpg;  He gasped, his hand instinctively going to the wall.  "No way... the entrance got blocked?!" he exclaimed, the urgency in his voice evident. 
12.29.A.jpg;  The two men stood frozen, the blue sparks emanating from the wall a stark reminder of the danger. The woman behind them looked worried, her hand clutching her phone.  
12.29.B.jpg;  The woman looked at the cracked glass door, her eyes wide with confusion.  "Is this some other dimension...?" she asked. 
12.29.C.jpg;  He reached out, his hand hovering over the cracked wall, the blue light emanating from it an eerie beacon. "It's different from normal dungeons." he observed, "I've never seen it before, but it should be similar to the red gate." 
12.30.A.jpg;  He lowered his head, worry etching lines on his face. "What do I do now?  I was planning to run if something bad happened." he thought, "If they block the exit then I can't even run away." 
12.30.B.jpg;  "You actually can't leave unless you kill the boss..." a message appeared above his head. "You cannot leave the dungeon. Either kill the boss or use the return crystal." he read, a sense of unease growing within him.  
12.30.C.jpg;  He scowled, a determined glint in his eye. "It was only a few days ago when I struggled with E-rank monsters, and now I'm supposed to clear this dungeon all by myself?" he thought.  
12.31.A.jpg;  He stared at the message, shock evident on his face.  "Damn, you gotta be kidding me..." he thought, completely taken aback by the situation. 
12.32.A.0.jpg;   "I'm seriously expected..." he thought, his brow furrowed in disbelief, "To manage this without a party?"  
12.32.A.1.jpg;  He grimaced, sweat beading on his forehead.  "To manage this without a party?!" he repeated, his heart sinking.
12.32.B.jpg;  The hallway stretched before him, the air thick with an unsettling energy. A dark blue aura swirled around him, whispering secrets of danger and mystery. 
13.0.A.jpg;  He stood there, a determined look on his face, his brow furrowed with concern.  "I'm seriously expected... to manage this without a party?!" he thought, a surge of doubt rising within him.

13.2.B.jpg;  The man continued down the hallway, the dim light at the end casting long, distorted shadows.  The air was thick with a sense of foreboding,  the silence broken only by the echo of his footsteps. 
13.3.A.jpg;  He looked around, his brow furrowed in worry. "What do I do?" he thought.  "I'm feeling less and less confident..."
13.3.B.jpg;  "Strong stench..." he thought, the air thick with a pungent, unsettling odor.  The metal gate stood imposingly in the corner, a dark shadow against the faint light emanating from the other side of the room.

13.7.A.1.jpg;  He sprinted, the wolf's growls echoing in his ears.  The dust swirling around him made it hard to see, but the red glow of the wolf's eyes was a constant reminder of the danger.

13.9.A.0.jpg;  He stood tall, a confident smile playing on his lips.  "Even one or two goblins are already hard enough for me..." he said, "So can I actually win against this?" 
13.9.A.1.jpg; The wolf snarled, its red eyes glowing in the darkness.  He looked down, his face pale, his body trembling with fear. 
13.10.A.0.jpg;  He clutched his leg, pain radiating through his body.  "My leg..." he groaned.
13.10.A.1.jpg;  He looked down at his leg, his heart sinking.  "It's not moving..." he whispered, his eyes darting to the wolf lurking in the shadows behind him. 
13.11.A.jpg;  He stood there, his fists clenched, his gaze fixed on the sky. "Why? Why...?" he asked. "Because I'm... scared? Is that it?"  
13.11.B.0.jpg;  He lowered his head, his brow furrowed with pain.  "I didn't think I had any serious traumas from back then..." he muttered, the memory of a past pain weighing heavily on his heart.

13.17.B.0.jpg;  The beast roared, its red eyes blazing with fury.  "You think I'll cower in fear?!" it bellowed, its voice echoing with rage.  The man met its gaze, his fist glowing with golden energy.

13.25.B.jpg;  He plants his foot, a determined glint in his eyes. "What do I have that can allow me to beat it?" he asks himself, a sense of resolve washing over him. "What I have is just my body.." he whispers, steeling himself for the fight.

Usually, I probably couldn't even afford to touch it, but I'll use this sword for now." he decides, a sense of wonder filling him. "An inventory, huh? That's pretty useful."

14.1.B.1.jpg;  He continues to analyze his stats, a determined glint in his eyes.  "Leveling up means all my stats go up by one, so I get a total of 5 points." he concludes, his mind buzzing with possibilities.

17.36.A.jpg;  "A bit more!"  the man yelled.  "Attack now!" the text above the claw commanded, and the rocks and debris around it swirled with energy.
17.36.B.jpg;  The creature's hand, a massive, clawed appendage, smashed down with unstoppable force.  The blue and black background shimmered with the energy of its attack, a dangerous event unfolding before their eyes.
17.37.A.jpg; "We did it!" the man with the sword cried out.  The blue creature, shattered and broken, fell from the sky, its descent a testament to their victory.  "We beat it!"  the text below the creature echoed their triumph.
17.38.A.jpg;  "What?!"  the man in armor exclaimed, his surprise evident.  "The attacks didn't work at all until a while ago, but it suddenly collapsed?"  He looked around, bewildered by the unexpected turn of events.
17.38.B.jpg;  "No."  the man muttered, his face grim.  "Our attacks did nothing."  He stood tall, his armor gleaming under the dark blue sky, a sense of impending doom settling over him.
17.38.C.jpg;  "What was that that flew in just then?"  the text above the jagged rocks questioned.  "Is that what made it fall down?"  The broken landscape, littered with spears and shards, whispered of the powerful force that had struck.
17.39.A.jpg;  "What in the world blew up this rock's head?!"  the text above the rock formation exclaimed. The shattered rock, a testament to the immense power of the attack, stood as a stark reminder of the incredible force that had been unleashed.
17.39.B.jpg;  The man, his shield raised, stood guard, his eyes fixed on the horizon.  The sword, glowing with a faint light, was planted firmly in the ground, a symbol of his unwavering determination.
17.39.C.jpg;  "A boss golem that could withstand attacks from 10 hunters." the text above the sword read, "was defeated by this..."  The glowing sword, protruding from the ground, was a testament to the incredible power that had brought down the formidable creature. 
17.39.D.jpg; "Excuse me!"  the woman in uniform called out.  Her gaze was fixed on the man, his hooded figure obscured by the rain.  "Just who?" he questioned.
17.41.A.jpg;  "Did you see who threw this?"  the man in camouflage asked, his back turned to the viewer.  The man in armor, his face serious, replied, "Yes?  Are you talking to me?"
17.41.B.jpg;  "Ah, the hunter over there..." one of the soldiers exclaimed, his eyes widening in surprise.  The rain fell around them, adding to the sense of uncertainty as they watched the events unfold.
17.41.C.jpg;  "Huh?  There was a hunter right there a moment ago?"  the man in armor questioned, his face etched with concern.  The soldier, his expression a mixture of surprise and confusion, could only stare.
17.42.A.jpg;  "That strength, that destructiveness..."  the man murmured, his gaze lost in the distance.  The rain continued to fall, a somber backdrop to his thoughts.
17.42.B.0.jpg;  "I didn't think it would fall in one hit."  The young man's voice was filled with sadness.  "Was he a high-ranked hunter?"  He stood in the rain, his face etched with concern.
17.42.B.1.jpg;  "Was its health lower than I expected?"  The man's thoughts drifted, his face clouded with uncertainty.  He stood in the light rain, lost in contemplation.
17.43.A.jpg;  "Jin-woo...?"  the woman whispered, her face a mixture of sadness and confusion.  Her blue eyes reflected the depth of her emotions as she searched for answers.
17.43.B.jpg;  The status screen displayed the details of Sung Jin-woo: Level 18, Fatigue 72, Job: None, Title: Wolf Slayer.  His strength and resilience were evident in the numbers, but the lack of a job and the high fatigue levels hinted at a struggle.
18.0.A.0.jpg;  The man, his white shirt torn, sat on the bed, his face contorted in pain.  The bright light from the window illuminated his suffering, highlighting the sadness that filled the hospital room. 
18.0.A.1.jpg;  The muscular man lay on his side, his right arm bent, his left resting on his stomach.  Sweat dripped from his chest, a testament to the exertion he had endured.
18.1.A.jpg;  The man, shirtless and determined, continued his push-up, his muscles straining under the effort.  The puddle of water beneath his hand was a testament to his sweat and the intensity of his workout.
18.2.A.jpg;  "I'm coming in." the woman announced.  "Oh!" the other woman exclaimed, her eyes wide with shock as she caught sight of the shirtless man doing push-ups.
18.2.B.jpg;  "No, it's my bad..."  the woman apologized, a blush creeping onto her cheeks.  The man, still shirtless and looking equally surprised, stood awkwardly beside her.
18.3.A.jpg;  "Wow..."  the woman whispered, her face flushed with awe.  Her wide eyes reflected the wonder she felt, overwhelmed by something she had witnessed.
18.3.B.0.jpg;  "This patient..."  the man pondered, his face thoughtful.  He stared at the floor, lost in contemplation, his mind racing with thoughts.
18.3.B.1.jpg;  "Was his body this chiseled when he came in?"  the woman questioned, her curiosity piqued.  Her gaze was fixed on the man's muscular physique, her surprise evident. 
18.4.A.jpg;  "Um... are you being discharged today?"  the man asked, a kind smile on his face.  "Yes." the woman replied, her smile mirroring his happiness, as they both looked forward to the day ahead. 
18.4.B.jpg;  "If it's okay with you, could I have your number?"  the man asked.  The woman, her eyes wide with surprise, could only stare at him, her mouth open in shock.
18.4.C.jpg;  "Number?"  the man asked nervously, his phone clutched in his hand.  "Yes... I mean, if you're okay with it..."  the woman stammered, her face flushed, as she looked down, unsure of how to respond. 
18.5.A.jpg;  The apartment building, a towering grey structure with colorful windows, stood peacefully against the clear blue sky.  The city, bustling with life, faded into the distance.
18.7.A.jpg;  The woman, her blue blazer and striped sweater a splash of color against the morning light, sat on the steps, her focus on tying her shoes.  She was preparing for the day ahead, her expression one of quiet anticipation.
18.7.B.jpg;  "Oi, Sung-jin! You're going to school?"  the text next to the woman read.  She stood before the door, her hand reaching for the knob, surprise evident on her face.
18.8.A.jpg;  "What? You were awake?"  the woman exclaimed.  The man, shirtless and grinning, stood before her, playfully lifting his shirt, enjoying her reaction.
18.8.B.jpg;  "It's been a while since I woke up." the text above the man read.  "Be careful of cars on the way."  he added.
18.8.C.jpg;  "You worked out?"  the text above the woman asked, her surprise evident.  She stood before the door, her expression a mixture of confusion and wonder.  "Uh... a bit?"  she mumbled, her cheeks turning pink.
18.9.A.jpg;  "Your body looks more toned, and I think you've gotten taller?"  the text above the man questioned.  The woman, one arm raised above her head, stared at him, her curiosity evident.  "Do men still grow after they turn twenty?"  she wondered aloud.
18.9.B.jpg;  "Stop talking nonsense and take an umbrella." the text above the man read, his annoyance clear.  The woman, holding a blue umbrella, shook her head.  "It doesn't look like it'll rain... and it's heavy." she argued.
18.10.A.jpg;  "It's a folding umbrella so it's not heavy." the text above the man insisted, his playful smile evident.  "Stop making such a fuss about it." he teased.  "Aw..."  the woman sighed, her exasperation clear, as he tucked the umbrella into her backpack.
18.10.B.jpg;  The man, his white shirt stark against the blue text on the screen, stood in silent contemplation, his expression troubled.  His mind was racing, wrestling with a difficult decision. 
18.11.A.jpg; "I guess I'll do the sprint later." the man thought, glancing at the incomplete quest on his menu.  The clock ticked away, a reminder of the impending deadline for his daily challenge. 
18.11.B.jpg;  "My muscles grew." the man marveled, flexing his bicep.  "There's no way that my physical state changed after exercising for just a few weeks."  he pondered, his eyes widening in realization. "So it definitely means that my status affects my body." 
18.12.A.jpg; The man, his white shirt lifted, examined his muscular torso, a satisfied smile spreading across his face.  "Since I keep increasing my strength stat, my body's probably changing accordingly." he thought, his confidence growing.
18.12.B.jpg;  "Maybe I put too many points on strength..."  the man worried, his brow furrowed as he stared at his status menu.  He felt a pang of doubt about his stat allocation. 
18.13.A.jpg;  "What happens if I keep putting points in?"  the man wondered, a flicker of apprehension crossing his face.  He imagined himself with an exaggeratedly muscular physique.  "Hopefully not this..." he muttered, his concern growing.
18.13.B.jpg;  "Even with high damage, it's not good without balance." the man realized, his finger tracing the lines on his status menu.  "The opposite is the same." he added, understanding the importance of a well-rounded set of stats.
18.13.C.jpg;  "Since the synergy between strength and agility is good, I'll put some into that."  the man decided, his gaze determined.  "Health is better the higher it gets, and sense is more useful than I imagined."  he added, his planning taking shape. 
18.14.A.jpg;  "Intelligence is the problem..." the man pondered, his eyes fixed on the chart.  "It seems to be related to magic, but do I need this?"  he questioned, his curiosity piqued.
18.14.B.jpg;  "I guess this should be fine?" the man said, a satisfied smile appearing on his face.  He reviewed his stats, confident in his choices.
18.15.A.jpg;  The man, his white shirt and blue jeans standing out against the brown couch, stood frozen, his posture tense.  His unease was palpable, a sense of anticipation hanging in the air. 
18.15.B.jpg;  "At last, you picked up!"  the man exclaimed.  He held the phone to his ear, his determined expression betraying his frustration.  He was tired of waiting, eager to finish this task.
18.16.A.jpg;  "I'm sorry, Mister Landlord, I got into an accident and was hospitalized." the man explained.  "Tsk tsk, no wonder." the text below him read, a hint of disapproval in the tone.
18.16.B.jpg;  "Well, that's that." the text above the man announced, his surprise evident.  "Student Jin-woo... I'm calling because this month's rent is due..."  He held the phone to his ear, his eyes wide with worry.  "Ah... yes..."  he stammered, struggling to regain his composure.
18.17.A.jpg;  "If you can't pay right now, should I delay your pay for a month?"  the text above the man asked.  "It's fine. I'll transfer it soon." he replied.  He leaned back, his good mood evident.
18.17.B.jpg;  The hand, its fingers trembling slightly, hovered over the red button on the phone.  It hesitated, a flicker of anxiety crossing its face.  The call was about to be placed, the outcome uncertain. 
18.17.C.jpg;  "Double awakening." the text above the man read, his face a mask of determination.  He stood tall, his mind racing, contemplating his next move.  His confidence in his abilities was unwavering.
18.18.A.jpg;  "If I'm really an awakened person, then I should be able to make money quickly." the man thought, his back turned to the viewer.  "If I continue to grow at this rate, then I'll soon be able to become a top-rank hunter." he mused, his ambition burning brightly.
18.19.A.jpg;  "Hunters kill monsters and make money." the text above the man read, as he swung his sword.  "The higher the experience." the text to the left declared, "the higher the rank." the text below confirmed.  He was locked in a battle for survival, his determination unwavering.
18.19.B.jpg;  "The more money the magic crystal drops are worth." the text above the group explained.  "To beat a high-rank monster, you need to enter through a gate of the same difficulty." the text to the left stated.  "So there's a lot of competition for D-rank or E-rank gates that can be entered by the masses of lower-ranked hunters." the text below summarized.  The men stood poised, ready to face the challenge.
18.20.A.jpg;  "Because of that, E-rank hunters aren't accepted by the guild, and even if they were, it wouldn't be easy to find a job." the text above the man explained.  "My guild rank is E, and for me, who never experienced a gate above D-rank, this is a harsh condition."  the text below added.  He sat, his shoulders slumped, the weight of his situation pressing down on him. 
18.20.B.jpg; The man, his brow furrowed with worry, studied the news report on the television.  "Should I just get reviewed and raise my rank?" he thought, his mind replaying the words "people are chosen based on competence, and back then I could not escape from the title of 'world's weakest hunter'."
18.21.A.jpg; He gazed at the television screen, his thoughts swirling. "The pay might be better the more attention I get." he mused, remembering his earlier statement, "but my awakening will become a wildfire if it's revealed." The masses enjoy gossip, and hunters are a good subject.
18.21.B.jpg; But... malicious eyes will fall upon me as well. The ominous red eyes filled the darkness, a chilling reminder of the danger. He had heard whispers about a hunter who could gain experience with time, growing stronger as he lived. "How is that possible?"
18.22.A.jpg; "I can't reveal it until I can be sure." he muttered to himself, his fingers tracing the contours of the remote.  The weight of his secret pressed upon him, urging him to be cautious.
18.22.B.jpg; "I'll make money first." he declared, a glint of determination in his eyes. "It would be great if I could enter an attack force first..." The phone in his hand seemed to vibrate with the excitement of his newfound purpose.
18.22.C.jpg; A sudden realization struck him, his eyes widening in surprise.  An exclamation point burst forth from his thoughts, a testament to the unexpected turn of events. 
18.24.A.jpg; The unfinished building stood tall against the backdrop of a clear sky, a testament to progress and hope.  The structure, nearing completion, represented a new beginning, a symbol of aspirations realized. 
18.24.B.jpg;  He stood tall, his face etched with determination, radiating an aura of confidence and unwavering resolve.  His black t-shirt and blue jeans, paired with the blue jacket, provided a sense of practicality, hinting at his readiness for action.
18.25.A.jpg; He observed the group of people gathered within the partially constructed building, their figures shrouded in the shadows of the unfinished structure. The air was thick with curiosity, a sense of mystery surrounding their activities.
18.25.B.0.jpg; "This way!" he called out, a wide grin splitting his face. The man, a towering figure with a silver gauntlet and a sword strapped to his back, led the group with enthusiasm. His comrades, one wearing a white shirt and the other draped in a green cape, followed closely behind. 
18.25.B.1.jpg; They walked in a relaxed manner, their journey a mix of adventure and anticipation. The path ahead, veiled in uncertainty, held a promise of exciting discoveries and challenges to overcome.
18.26.A.jpg;  "I'm Hwang Dong-suk. What's your name again?"  The muscular man extended his hand, a hint of skepticism in his eyes. "Sung Jin-woo." he replied, his hand meeting the other man's. "You're an E-rank, correct?" 
18.26.B.jpg;  "Yes..." the woman smiled, her eyes fixed on the man in the blue jacket. "Ah! I know him." she exclaimed. "He's a pretty famous person..."
18.26.C.jpg; "What was his nickname..." the blonde man pondered, a surprised expression etched across his face. "World's Weakest Hunter?" he exclaimed,  "Pfft! What the hell."
18.27.A.jpg;  "Stop it." the muscular man pleaded. "It's okay. The most important thing is numbers." he reasoned, trying to make sense of the situation.
18.27.B.jpg; "As I said on the phone, it's going to be hard for you to fight as it's a C-rank gate. So you're exempted from fighting." he explained, a sly smirk playing on his lips. "But I'll pay you 2,000,000 won for filling up our member count. It's a good deal, right?"  "Yes..." he replied, a sense of desperation creeping into his voice.  "Then please sign this contract."
18.28.A.0.jpg; The man's piercing blue eyes met the viewer's, radiating power and determination.  His hand rested on the hilt of a sword, a silent threat that whispered of danger and readiness for any challenge. 
18.28.A.1.jpg;  "5 C-ranks." he stated, his arms crossed, a commanding presence exuding from him. "4 that are lower than D-rank." he added, the weight of his words highlighting his authority. 
18.29.A.jpg; "Because of that, there are cases where only numbers make up the attack force." he explained, a sense of frustration creeping into his voice.  "Always a bridesmaid." he muttered, feeling underestimated. "Excuse me, it seems we're both small fries." he declared, a glimmer of determination in his eyes.
18.29.B.jpg; "I'm Yoo Jin-ho. I'm twenty-two, and the rank's D." he introduced himself, a confident smile gracing his lips.  "I was called here as well, under the same circumstance." he added, his tone suggesting he was ready for whatever this new situation held. 
18.31.A.jpg;  This guy... he looked at the blurred figure, surprise and confusion etched across his face.  "Ah... ok..." he muttered, trying to process the unexpected encounter. 
18.31.B.0.jpg; The man, clad in orange and white armor, beamed with pride. "What's with the flashy equipment?!" he thought, a hint of amusement in his eyes.
18.31.B.1.jpg;  He stood, his sword held confidently in his hand, a glint of determination in his eyes. "Are you the son of a millionaire?!" he wondered aloud, his tone laced with curiosity.
18.32.A.jpg; "Then what should I do?" he asked, his gaze fixed on the white paper in his hand. "Nothing much, just follow us and take care of our baggage." the bearded man responded, a hint of amusement in his voice. 
18.32.B.jpg;  Inside there are packed food, clothes and equipment, a first aid kit... just about everything. The bag sat heavy on the ground, a testament to the necessities of their journey.
18.33.A.jpg; "Are we going without a healer?" he asked, worry etched across his face. The thought of venturing into a dungeon without a healer filled him with apprehension.
18.33.B.jpg; "You know how hard it is to bring a healing hunter to a personal attack force." the bearded man explained, a smile on his face. "We always did it this way."
18.33.C.jpg; "A force made out of only tanks and damage dealers." he muttered, frustration evident in his voice. "What a mess."
18.34.A.jpg; "I accept that I won't blame anyone else for any accidents inside the dungeon." he read, his brow furrowed in thought. "There's no healer so this is a bit hard to accept..."
18.34.B.jpg; "Sir, let's go inside." the man in the green cloak urged, a smile on his face.  "We'll beat them all anyway so you don't need to explain so much!" the others chimed in, their voices filled with confidence. 
18.35.A.jpg; "It's time we went inside." he declared, a determined grin spreading across his face. His stubble beard and wide-open smile hinted at his unwavering resolve. 
18.36.A.jpg; "Stop worrying so much." the man in the dark blue suit reassured, his armored hand resting on the other man's shoulder. 
18.36.B.jpg; "You said you were E-rank?" the man with bright orange hair asked, a mischievous twinkle in his eye. "I'll protect you." he declared, winking playfully. 
18.37.A.jpg;  "Haha.." he chuckled, his tongue sticking out playfully. His laughter was a mix of amusement and excitement, a sign of his lighthearted spirit. 
18.37.B.jpg;  The status menu displayed his current stats: Name: Sung Jin-woo. Level: 18. Job: None. Fatigue: 0. Title: Wolf Slayer. HP: 2220. MP: 350. Strength: 50. Stamina: 27. Agility: 35. Intelligence: 27. Sense: 29. Remaining Points: 0.
19.0.A.0.jpg;  The towering building, adorned with scaffolding, stood tall against the backdrop of a fiery sunset.  The orange hues painted the sky, creating a scene of peaceful tranquility. 
19.0.A.1.jpg;  The group of people stood in front of the stacks of wood, their eyes fixed on the construction site, a testament to hope and progress.  The building behind them, a symbol of aspirations realized, stood as a beacon of a brighter future.
19.1.A.jpg; His arm extended, a testament to his determination, a symbol of his unwavering resolve. The man, his face set with a steely gaze, was ready to take action. 
19.1.B.jpg; His hand, clenched tightly around the metal object, radiated tension and focus.  His brow furrowed, his body taut with anticipation, he was poised for the next move. 
19.1.C.jpg;  The sharp, pointed sword, held firmly in his hand, exuded danger and sharpness.  A silent promise of protection, it was a symbol of his power and readiness to face any threat. 
19.2.A.jpg;  The man, burdened by a backpack laden with pickaxes, trudged forward, his head bent in pain. "Mumble." he muttered.  The urgency of his mission weighed heavily on him. 
19.3.A.0.jpg; "Let us go!" The eight figures stood in a defiant line, their gazes fixed on an unseen foe. The man in golden armor, his sword held high, led the charge, his determination palpable. 
19.3.A.1.jpg; The man, with his blue-strapped armor and a confident smile, stood tall, his gaze unwavering.  The dust motes danced in the air, creating a hazy atmosphere around him. 
19.3.B.jpg;  The scaffolding structures, dilapidated and draped in tattered cloth, stood as a silent testament to emptiness and abandonment.  The once vibrant sun now cast a melancholic glow upon the desolate landscape. 
19.4.A.jpg;  "Is it because Gyeonggi isn't good lately?" he wondered, his gaze fixed on the ruined building. "It seems like the construction was postponed recently."  He pondered the situation, his mind searching for answers.
19.4.B.jpg; "The boss ran away overseas with 9,000,000,000 won just two weeks ago." the man in golden armor revealed.  "The workers and funders are having a hard time." The man in the blue jacket listened intently. "Why are you telling me that...?" he asked, his brow furrowed with worry.
19.5.A.jpg;  "Isn't that bag heavy? Will you be fine?" the man in red armor asked. "Ah... yes, I can carry it." he replied, his gaze fixed on the ground, his determination unwavering. 
19.5.B.jpg;  "Thanks to the strength stat this is nothing..." he explained, a smile gracing his lips. "No need to be so formal." he added, a sense of relief washing over him. 
19.5.C.jpg;  "Are you normally this quiet?" the blonde man asked, his arm slung around the other man's shoulder.  "I think it's you who talks a bit too much..." the man in the blue jacket replied, a smirk playing on his lips.  Their lighthearted banter filled the air, a testament to their growing camaraderie. 
19.6.A.jpg;  "Did I bother you by talking too much?" he asked, a hint of concern in his voice.  "People never really took notice of me." he muttered, his finger resting on his temple, a contemplative look on his face.  His happiness was tinged with a hint of self-doubt. 
19.6.B.jpg;  "Being a hunter is my hobby." the man in the white suit smirked, his legs crossed, radiating an aura of arrogance.  The man in the blue shirt clenched his fist, anger simmering in his eyes.  "Conglomerate." he muttered.  The air crackled with tension, anticipation building for the inevitable clash.
19.7.A.jpg;  "We're here." the man with brown hair growled, his anger evident in his voice.  The man with orange hair, his sword held at the ready, stood behind him, his expression as grim as the situation.  The man in the blue jacket, his hands gripping his jacket, stood on the opposite side, his gaze fixed on the approaching threat.  The air hummed with urgency, the anticipation of conflict palpable.
19.7.B.jpg;  The group of people stood in the field, their eyes fixed on the massive blue opening before them.  "Wow." one exclaimed, their voices filled with awe.  "The entrance is pretty big."  "This is pretty unusual." another added, their words laced with curiosity.  Their formation, a testament to their preparedness, suggested they were ready to face whatever lay beyond.
19.8.A.jpg;  "Are you sure this is a C-rank gate? It's a bit big." the man with brown hair questioned, his brow furrowed with doubt.  "Are you saying the guild is untrustworthy? I've seen people go in and out plenty of times." the man in the blue jacket retorted, his arms crossed.  The tension between them was palpable, a testament to their conflicting opinions.
19.8.B.jpg;  "The gate looks a bit too big, but it should be fine, right?" the man in armor questioned.  "Is this your first time?" the man in the blue jacket inquired, his gaze fixed on the ground, a hint of amusement in his tone. The air crackled with curiosity and a subtle undercurrent of anxiety.
19.9.A.jpg;  "A gate's size isn't that important." the text read, illuminating the dark background.  "The important thing is the magical energy flowing from within."  "The guild determines the amount and quality of the energy and gives it a rank. A large guild takes care of gates above B-rank, and C-rank gates and lower aren't that dangerous." The words hung in the air, a mixture of explanation and reassurance, attempting to dispel the looming darkness.
19.9.B.jpg;  "...Although that's the case, it's my first time at a C-rank gate.." he confessed, a hint of unease in his voice. His gaze, fixed on the horizon, betrayed his nervousness.  The tension, a tangible presence, hung heavy in the air. 
19.10.A.jpg;  "I'm heading in first. Everyone follow me!" he declared, a confident smirk playing on his lips.  His sword, held at the ready, was a symbol of his leadership, his determination shining bright.
19.10.B.jpg;  The hand, gripping the large sword, exuded strength and power.  The blue, white, and yellow accents accentuated its might, a testament to its destructive capabilities.
19.10.C.jpg;  The sword, captured in close-up, appeared to hum with power and speed.  The blue and white accents, a dazzling spectacle, hinted at its immense potential, a weapon capable of unleashing devastating force.  
19.11.A.0.jpg;  "Yes!" the man in golden armor exclaimed, his sword raised in triumph.  The other man, his eyes wide with shock, stood behind him, his fear palpable.  The dungeon echoed with the clang of steel, a testament to the battle that had just unfolded. 
19.11.A.1.jpg;  "Normally D and E-ranks like me don't make much money, so they barely can scrape together weapons and can't even consider shields..." he mused, his brow furrowed with confusion. "Why does this D-rank have such good equipment?!" He couldn't shake the feeling of suspicion, a sense of unease settling over him.
19.12.A.jpg; "Let's go!" he declared, his eyes gleaming with confidence.  "Ok... but let's not walk side by side." he added, a hint of caution in his voice.  He was ready for whatever lay ahead, but he wasn't about to take unnecessary risks. 
19.12.B.jpg;  "Looks like this personal force makes a decent amount of money." he observed, his gaze scanning his companions. "Everyone is equipped well..."  The man in the red shirt nodded in agreement. "It's pretty different from the D and E-rank dungeons I've been in so far."  "Mister Song Chi-yeol is C-rank but he's a magician, so..." he trailed off, a sense of curiosity and suspicion hanging in the air.
19.13.A.0.jpg; "It's way too dark." he muttered, his hand instinctively reaching for his sword.  "Gyu-hwan, create some light." he commanded.  The dungeon, shrouded in darkness, held an air of mystery and danger, demanding caution and preparedness.
19.13.A.1.jpg;  "Ok." the man in the green cloak replied. The air, thick with anticipation, was heavy with unspoken fears.  The darkness, their only companion, amplified their sense of unease.
19.13.B.jpg;  The hand, cradling the ball of light, glowed with an otherworldly energy, illuminating the darkness. The light, a beacon of hope, radiated warmth and power, a testament to the unknown forces at play.
19.14.A.0.jpg;  "What is this...?" he whispered, his gaze fixed on the uneven ground.  "Why are there no monsters?" he questioned, confusion etched on his face.  The silence, broken only by the sound of their own footsteps, added to the sense of mystery.
19.14.A.1.jpg;  "Weird, there are no lights as well." one man remarked.  "It's normal for dungeons to have a few luminous stones." another added, his expression a mixture of confusion and concern.  The vast cavern, shrouded in darkness, was a strange and unsettling sight, prompting a sense of unease. 
19.14.B.jpg;  "Are there dungeons with no monsters?" he whispered, his finger pressed to his lips.  "Sh." he added, a sense of urgency in his tone.  His gaze, fixed on the man in the gold armor, betrayed his suspicion, his mind racing with questions and doubts. 
19.15.A.jpg;  Their words, laced with concern, echoed in the shadowy room.  The urgency of the situation was palpable, the silence broken only by the sound of their worried whispers.
19.16.A.jpg;  That means it's possible that the monsters don't depend on sight, and move in packs, live in darkness and charge towards lights?  The question hung in the air, a chilling possibility, adding a new layer of intrigue to the already mysterious dungeon.
19.16.B.jpg;  "It's insect-type monsters!!" he shouted.  The man in the brown shirt, his face contorted with fear, stood frozen in place, the realization of the threat dawning on him. 
19.17.A.jpg;   An insect-type?  The thought hung in the air, a chilling possibility.  "Could this be an ant nest?" one of them whispered.  "Don't say that!" another hissed, their fear palpable.
19.17.B.jpg;  "The sound is close!"  "There are too many tunnels!"  "What? Why can't I see them?"  "Can you see anything?"  "I can't see anything!" The whispers, filled with apprehension, echoed through the cave, their fear growing with each passing moment.
19.18.A.jpg;  He stood, his shield and sword held at the ready, his eyes scanning the darkness, a sense of anticipation radiating from him. The wooden floor creaked beneath his weight, each step a silent countdown to the inevitable confrontation.
19.18.B.0.jpg;  "Aaaagh!" he screamed, his surprise echoing in the dark cavern. His eyes, wide with shock, reflected the terror that gripped his heart.
19.18.B.1.jpg;  "Above!!" they shouted, their voices filled with alarm.  The darkness, their only enemy, seemed to amplify their fear.  Their weapons, clutched tightly in their hands, offered a glimmer of hope in the face of the unknown.
19.19.A.jpg;  His gaze, fixed on the ground, reflected his concern.  The shadows seemed to dance around him, whispering threats, and his intuition screamed danger.  The silence, a deafening presence, heightened his sense of unease.
19.20.A.jpg; "Darn!! Above?!" the man in the white and gold suit yelled, his sword and shield held high.  "Stay right next to me!" the man in the brown shirt commanded. his sword glinting menacingly in the darkness.  The air crackled with tension, their words a testament to their readiness for the impending battle. 
19.20.B.0.jpg;  They appeared!!  The red lights, scattered throughout the darkness, pulsed ominously, sending a chill down their spines.  The air, thick with a sense of foreboding, whispered of impending danger.
19.20.B.1.jpg;  Above us!!  The massive red creature, its glowing eyes piercing the darkness, loomed above them, its menacing jaw agape, a terrifying spectacle that sent shivers down their spines.
19.21.A.0.jpg;  What are these numbers?!  The red crabs, swarming around the small group of people, were a formidable foe.  "Use magic!"  "Ground them!"  The cries echoed through the dungeon, a desperate plea for survival as the people struggled against the overwhelming odds. 
19.21.A.1.jpg;  Get them off the ceiling!  There are too many!!  Panic filled the air as they realized the true extent of the threat.  The ceiling, a writhing mass of red crabs, was a terrifying sight, their desperate pleas for help echoing through the dungeon. 
19.21.B.jpg;  The staff glowed with an intense yellow light, a powerful energy emanating from the figure as they unleashed a devastating explosion.  Their smile, a testament to their confidence, was a beacon of hope in the face of overwhelming odds.
19.22.A.jpg;  The man with brown hair, his hand on his head, staggered back, shock and disbelief etched on his face.  The person above him, clad in black, red, and yellow, seemed to tower over him, a silent reminder of the sheer power they wielded. 
19.23.A.jpg;  He stood, his sword and shield held high, his face hardened with determination, a fierce warrior facing his foes.  The spiders, their large forms a menacing sight, seemed to cower before his unwavering resolve. 
19.23.B.jpg;   "Over here!" he yelled. his sword pointed toward the left.  The swirling pink energy around him seemed to amplify his warning, a testament to the danger that lurked in the shadows.
19.23.C.jpg;  The insects, their sharp teeth bared, charged toward their prey, their red and black bodies a blur of motion. Their sharp claws, poised to strike, promised a painful and swift end.
19.24.A.0.jpg;  "Yes! This way, insects!" he shouted, his sword raised in defiance.  "Damage dealers! Do something!!" he urged.  He stood atop the swarm of insects, a beacon of hope, his courage inspiring his allies. 
19.24.A.1.jpg;  The man with ginger hair, enveloped in a bright blue and white glow, swung his sword with a whoosh, his movements a blur of speed and power.  Behind him, the man in the black suit, a dark blue aura swirling around him, moved with an equally impressive agility, their combined force a mesmerizing display of combat prowess.
19.25.A.jpg; The three men, their swords flashing in the blue cave, moved with coordinated precision, their movements a blur of speed and strength.  The red and white background, a testament to the intensity of the battle, pulsed with energy, each strike a testament to their skill and determination.
19.25.B.jpg;  "C-rank hunters!" he whispered, his brow furrowed with concern. "Their teamwork is good!"  The young man, his eyes wide with a mixture of admiration and unease, observed the hunters' performance, their skill and synergy a stark contrast to what he was accustomed to.
19.25.C.jpg;  "If it's this much, they can create a force with no healers." the man with the crossbow and sword observed.  "Jin-seok, 11 o'clock!" the man with the shield called out.  "They're on the right as well!" the woman in the yellow cloak shouted, her eyes scanning the battlefield. "Leader Hwang Dong-seok is fulfilling his duty well." the text above her declared, a testament to his leadership.  "And the damage dealers have good timing." the text above the crossbow-wielding man affirmed, praising their strategic prowess.
19.26.A.jpg;  "Jun-te, Suk-min, Gyo-hwan! You guys take care of the right!" the man in the brown jacket commanded.  "They've been fighting together for some time." the man with the sword confirmed, his words laced with respect.  "Yessir!" the man on the left replied. their teamwork a testament to their long-standing bond.
19.26.B.jpg;  The man, his eyes glowing red, swung his sword with a fierce determination, his silhouette a blur of motion against the dark blue backdrop.  The silence of the cave was broken only by the clang of steel, a haunting symphony of combat.
19.28.A.jpg;  "Everyone's doing well but..." he mused, his gaze fixed on the battlefield, a sense of unease creeping into his voice.  The swarm of red insects, a constant threat, filled him with a sense of unease, their relentless attacks a constant source of concern.
19.28.C.jpg;  He moved swiftly, his blue jacket billowing in the wind, his blue backpack bouncing against his back.  The red insects, a swirling mass of danger, buzzed around him, their presence a chilling reminder of the threat that loomed.
19.29.A.jpg;  His leg, a blur of motion, propelled him forward, his blue shirt a flash of color against the blue sky.  He moved with an effortless grace, his strength and speed a testament to his dedication.
19.29.B.jpg;  "This is a bit frustrating." he thought, his brow furrowed, his frustration palpable.  The situation, far from ideal, filled him with a sense of unease, a desire for a more decisive outcome. 
19.30.A.0.jpg; Scattered across the ground, the red creatures lay motionless, their many legs twitching weakly. "Are we heading back after cleaning out the entrance?" the character asked, their dark expression reflecting the danger and suspense surrounding them. 
19.30.A.1.jpg; Smiling with determination, the character offered advice to the other, their words echoing through the air, "Take things slowly, don't exert yourself too much." The other character, wearing a green shirt, nodded eagerly, "Yes!" 
19.30.B.jpg; The group of heroes huddled together, their gratitude radiating outwards. "You saved us before." one whispered. "This is my favorite part." chimed in another. "Mine too." the third agreed. The standing hero, a towering figure with brown boots, raised his hand. "Take all the magic crystals! We're splitting them among nine!" He then turned to the group, a curious glint in his eyes, "How did you know the monsters were coming from above?"
19.31.A.jpg; The character with black hair, dressed in a blue jacket, stared intently at the ground, his serious expression betraying a deep concern. "I just... felt it." he muttered, his senses tingling with an unyielding certainty. The other character, adorned in blue, responded with a knowing smile, "As expected, the sense stat does more than what meets the eye. Your senses are sharp." 
19.31.B.jpg; Dong-suk, the character with brown hair, beamed at the group, relief washing over his features. "It's great that everyone was taken care of cleanly. Thank you." he said sincerely. "But it would be good if you didn't pay attention to small things that much."  The character with black hair on the ground, seemingly confused, simply said, "Huh?".  He then turned to Dong-suk, "Dong-suk! Come look at this!" 
19.32.A.jpg; The red creature lay lifeless on the ground, its wounds a stark reminder of the battle's brutality. "Look at their wounds." one character observed. "It's not a blade wound, we didn't inflict this, I guess?" Another added. "Right? It's not a burn from magic either, it seems like they were bitten off." a third chimed in. "And there aren't just one or two of these."
19.32.B.jpg;  Dong-suk, examining the creature with a thoughtful expression, muttered, "So it was like this before fighting us? Were the monsters having a territorial feud amongst themselves?"  
19.33.A.0.jpg; A sinister smile crept across the character's face, revealing a chilling glint in their eye. "This..." they whispered, the words laced with malice and a promise of impending danger.
19.33.A.1.jpg;  The other character, a burly figure with a thick beard, mirrored the first, his own sinister smile mirroring the darkness that consumed them. 
19.34.A.jpg;  Three shadowy figures stood against a backdrop of swirling blue and red, their eyes glowing an ominous red.  The figure in the back, barely visible in the darkness, chuckled, "Smells like money." his voice dripping with greed and excitement.  
19.34.B.jpg;  Jin-ho, the man with dark hair, stood tall, his blue eyes piercing the viewer with an intensity that commanded respect and admiration. "That sword and shield are expensive, right?" the man with brown hair asked, his gaze fixed on Jin-ho's impressive weaponry.  
19.35.A.jpg; The man with black hair, dressed in a blue shirt, stared forward, a resolute expression etched on his face. "Yes? Oh, my father took extra care after hearing that I'm going on my first raid." he responded.  "I'm not sure but..." he continued, his words trailing off as his mind raced with a new thought.
19.36.A.0.jpg;  "What is this?" the man with black hair exclaimed, his face contorted in shock and confusion. He looked like he'd been caught off guard, a blue bag filled with shovels strapped to his back. A second man, clad in a red suit, stood in the background, a surprised look on his face as he observed the unfolding situation. 
19.36.A.1.jpg;  A figure, partially concealed in the shadows, stood before the viewer. Only his right shoulder, arm, and part of his chest were visible, his blue shirt and brown belt barely illuminating the darkness that engulfed him.  His concerned expression, tinged with a hint of mystery, held the viewer's attention, leaving them to ponder the secrets that lay hidden within the shadows. 
20.0.A.jpg; The man with brown hair, his face beaming with excitement, turned to his companion, his orange and white suit a stark contrast to the somber surroundings. "That sword and shield are expensive, right?" he inquired. "Yes? Oh, my father took extra care after hearing that I'm going on my first raid." the unseen figure responded, his words adding to the air of anticipation.
20.0.B.jpg;  "I'm not sure but..." the man with dark hair said, his determined expression unwavering. He looked forward, his gaze intense, as if absorbing the weight of the upcoming challenge. "You should be wary." a voice whispered from the depths of his mind, a stark reminder of the dangers that lay ahead.
20.1.A.0.jpg; "What is this?" the man with black hair exclaimed, his face etched with shock and confusion. His blue shirt and backpack filled with shovels offered no comfort in the face of this unexpected encounter.  A second man, dressed in a red suit, stood in the background, his surprised expression mirroring the bewilderment of the man in the foreground. 
20.1.A.1.jpg;  A figure, shrouded in mystery, stood before the viewer. Only his right shoulder, arm, and a sliver of his chest were visible, his blue shirt and brown belt offering a glimpse into the darkness that enveloped him. His concerned expression, tinged with a hint of apprehension, held the viewer's gaze captive, leaving them to speculate on the secrets that lay hidden within the shadows.
20.2.A.jpg;  The dungeon, a dark and forbidding chasm, stretched into the earth's depths, its cavernous mouth swallowing the light that dared to venture within. "A dungeon's size varies, but not according to rank." a voice echoed from the darkness, its words heavy with unspoken danger. 
20.3.A.jpg;  A map, meticulously drawn, laid out the labyrinthine pathways of the dungeon, its intricate lines promising a journey fraught with peril and excitement. "Depending on the circumstances, there are times when it takes weeks to analyse the interior." a caption read, hinting at the dungeon's complexity.  At the bottom of the map, a red circle, emblazoned with the word "Boss" and a menacing devil face, served as a stark reminder of the ultimate challenge that awaited.  
20.3.B.jpg;  The man with short black hair, his face etched with quiet determination, shouldered two large bags, his light blue jacket a stark contrast to the dark, rocky landscape. "My job was the baggage carrier." he thought, "I didn't really need to get involved in battles."
20.5.A.0.jpg;  The group of adventurers, relaxed and content, enjoyed a meal beneath a towering cliff. "To be able to earn money without fighting..." one man mused, his chopsticks poised over a steaming bowl.  "I thought it was a decent deal." he added with a smile.
20.5.A.1.jpg;  The man with short black hair, his brow furrowed in concern, glanced down at the ground. Behind him, a woman with long black hair, her yellow shirt a beacon of warning, stood close, a man with short brown hair flanking her.  "Beware of lizards." a blue sign warned at the top of the image. "An unexpected warning." a second caption read,  adding to the air of suspense. 
20.7.A.jpg;  The man with short black hair, his blue eye piercing and his expression serious, stood in stark contrast to the man with a wide, toothy grin below him.  The man with brown skin and a goatee seemed to radiate warmth, a stark contrast to the coldness of the blue background. 
20.7.B.jpg;  The man with the beard, his sword resting on his hip, stood vigilant, his gaze fixed on the horizon. The woman with long black hair, her yellow shirt a vibrant splash of color against the dark orange backdrop, stood beside him, her expression mirroring his apprehension.  "This is grave." a caption read above the man, confirming their worst fears. 
20.8.A.jpg;  A figure, clad in green jacket and brown armor, stood amidst a brown landscape, his body obscured by a text bubble.  "Quite a while has passed, but we still haven't found any monsters with limbs intact." the text read, "There are only..." 
20.8.B.jpg;  Three red insects, their green markings a stark contrast to the brown background, lay lifeless on the ground, a trail of green goo marking their final moments. "Corpses and dying monsters since a while ago." a caption read above them. "But there should be a boss, right?" a second caption questioned. "If there's no boss, the gate wouldn't be open." a final thought echoed from the page. 
20.9.A.jpg;  The bearded man, his black hair cut short, his black shirt and brown pants blending with the brown background, stood with his sword strapped to his hip. "Wait." he commanded. "Gyu-wan, illuminate that area." he instructed, his gaze fixed on the man to his right.  
20.9.B.jpg;  The woman, her long black hair flowing around her, cradled a bright yellow orb in her hand, its glowing light bathing her in a soft radiance. Her green cloak, a stark contrast to the orange background, seemed to amplify the mystery of the moment.  A single question mark hovered above her head, reflecting the confusion and anticipation hanging in the air.  
20.10.A.0.jpg;  A monstrous creature, its sharp teeth and large claws hidden beneath a purple cloth, stood amidst a swirling mass of dark purple substance.  "My god..." a voice whispered, the words dripping with horror and disgust. 
20.10.A.1.jpg;  The five adventurers, their backs to the viewer, were trapped in a web of white thread, their silhouettes barely visible against the bright light shining behind them.  The man in the middle, clad in black shirt and white pants, held his shield and sword, a grim determination etched on his face.  "If the other hunters get to it first, our profits would dwindle." a voice whispered, the words echoing the danger and tension that filled the air.
20.12.A.jpg;  The six adventurers huddled together, their faces illuminated by the pale light of the forest clearing, as they stared up at a large hole in the ground.  The hole, shrouded in a web of thick, white thread, seemed to beckon them, its dark depths promising both mystery and danger. 
20.12.B.jpg;  The large hole in the ground, encircled by a web of thick, white thread, stretched into the unknown.  "It's the boss room." a caption read, the words confirming the perilous nature of the situation. 
20.13.A.jpg;  The man with short black hair, his beard framing his determined features, stood before the viewer, his gaze unwavering.  "Get ready." a caption read above him, the words carrying a weight of impending danger. 
20.14.A.jpg;  The man with black hair and brown eyes, dressed in a tan jacket, stared at the group of figures ahead, his surprise palpable.  The characters, their silhouettes barely visible as they walked through a tunnel, seemed to have stumbled upon something unexpected.  "Huh?!" he exclaimed, his words echoing the confusion and surprise that gripped him. 
20.14.B.jpg;  The group of adventurers, their faces alight with excitement and anticipation, stood before a sight that left them speechless. "T-this is!" the man in the middle exclaimed. "J-Jackpot!" a woman beside him cried out, her words confirming their wildest dreams. 
20.15.A.jpg;  A dazzling array of bright blue crystals, their surfaces shimmering with an ethereal glow, lay clustered together, encased in a web of white thread.  "Mana crystals?!" a voice whispered, awestruck. "How many are there?" another asked, their eyes wide with wonder. "Wow, this is amazing!" a third exclaimed, their words echoing the awe and excitement that filled the air.
20.16.A.jpg;  The woman with black hair, her yellow shirt and brown jacket a vibrant contrast to the blue crystals before her, looked up in amazement. "It's worth less than monster-dropped crystals because of its low energy, but..." she began. "If it's this many, I guess they should fetch a higher price than magic crystals?"  she continued, her gaze fixed on the glittering treasures. "Just looking at them, they should fetch over 10,000,000 won." she added. 
20.16.B.jpg;  The man with short black hair, his grey shirt and pants blending with the room's shadows, chuckled, a mischievous glint in his eye. "If it's this much, I think even your younger brother would be jealous." he teased. The woman with long black hair, her green cloak a vibrant splash of color, rolled her eyes, her annoyed expression a testament to his playful banter. 
20.17.A.jpg;  The man with short black hair and a beard, his black shirt and brown straps a stark contrast to the blue crystals before him, stood with his gaze fixed on the glittering treasures.  "Hwan Dong-soo... look at this, you're not always correct." he said, a hint of amusement in his voice, his words directed at the second character standing behind him.  
20.17.B.jpg;  "Ignoring me just because you obtained a high rank... and even ditching your country for America just because of money?" the man with black hair seethed, his anger radiating off him like heat.  He glared at the man with black hair standing with his arms crossed, a confident smirk playing on his lips. 
20.18.A.jpg;  "I can tell he's still being treated as a VIP in America and he is ignoring me." the man with black hair muttered, his gaze fixed on the large blue formation before him. "Don't think of me as a brother that will grovel at his younger brother's knees." he added. "I will take advantage of this situation and increase my squad's manpower."
20.18.B.jpg;  The man in blue armor, a wide grin splitting his face, addressed the other two men. "What a haul! Even after dividing it, it's 1,000,000 won each?" he exclaimed.  "Hand me the contract you signed earlier for a second." he continued, his eyes twinkling with mischief.  "I like to check these things thoroughly." 
20.19.A.jpg;  The three men, their faces etched with seriousness, stood before a blue object, their expressions reflecting the gravity of the situation.  "Sirs, I have something to ask you quickly." the man in the middle said.
20.19.B.jpg;  The man with brown hair, his eyes sparkling with excitement, held up a piece of paper, his finger tracing the words. "Leader Hwang Dong-suk, this is Jin-woo's contract." he announced. "As you can see, there is nothing about dividing except for magic crystals from monsters."
20.20.A.jpg;  The six men, their expressions a mixture of confusion and anger, stood in the dark room, their eyes fixed on a point in the distance.  "What's going on here?" one man questioned.  "Isn't it correct to divide the mana crystals among 10, not 9?" another added. 
20.20.B.jpg;  The man with brown hair and a beard, his black shirt and grey straps a stark contrast to the blue object behind him, smiled confidently, his eyes meeting the viewer's. "Of course, we're splitting it evenly." he assured them, his words dripping with certainty. "I know that well."
20.21.A.jpg;  The six men, their faces etched with confusion, shuffled along a blue surface, their steps hesitant and unsure. "But there is something to take care of before that." a voice whispered, the words leaving the men with a renewed sense of unease. "?!"  a caption echoed, adding to the air of uncertainty.
20.21.B.jpg;  The creature, its eight red eyes gleaming in the darkness, sat with its sharp teeth bared, its gaze fixed on the viewer, its menacing presence radiating a palpable sense of fear. 
20.22.A.0.jpg;  The spider, its brown body and red eyes a stark contrast to the white web it occupied, sat perched in the darkness, its eight legs poised for attack, its menacing appearance a stark warning to any who dared to approach. 
20.22.A.1.jpg; The four adventurers stood in awe, their faces illuminated by the eerie blue glow emanating from the crystals that filled the cave.  They had stumbled upon a treasure trove, their eyes widening in amazement at the sheer beauty and abundance of the crystals.
20.23.A.jpg;  The younger character, his brow furrowed with concern, turned to the older man. "You should know all too well, but once the boss is defeated, the gate closes." he explained. The older man, his beard a testament to his years of experience, nodded somberly. "Because of that, we must mine and transport the mana crystals before defeating the spider." he instructed, his words emphasizing the importance of their task.
20.23.B.jpg;  The monstrous spider, its many eyes gleaming in the darkness, lay slumbering in the depths of the dungeon. "Thankfully, it looks like it's sleeping after its stomach was filled... and this seems like the best chance to move the crystals." a voice whispered, its words filled with cautious optimism.
20.24.A.jpg;  The two adventurers, their faces a mixture of disbelief and amusement, stood amidst the glittering crystals.  "Sorry." the character in armor said. "Who would expect there would be mana crystals in a C-rank dungeon?"
20.24.B.jpg;  The character in the middle, his face flushed with frustration, gestured towards the right. "Idiot... didn't I tell you to make a habit of bringing it around with you?" he said.  "I left all the mining gear in the car." he explained, his words echoing the disappointment that hung in the air.
20.25.A.jpg;  The two adventurers, their expressions a mix of guilt and disappointment, stood in the cave, the blue crystals casting an eerie glow around them.  "Phew, this is troublesome." the character in armor said.  "I'm sorry. I'm sorry." he repeated, his words a testament to his remorse. 
20.25.B.jpg;  The character in blue jacket, his face etched with concern, turned to his companion. "I apologize, but could you two guard this place? I think we'll have to go and bring our equipment." he said.
20.26.A.jpg;  The two adventurers, their faces tense with anxiety, stood amidst the glittering crystals.  "Are you telling us to stay here by ourselves in the boss room?" the character in armor asked.  "It's fine, it's fine." the character in black jacket reassured him, his words barely masking his own unease.
20.26.B.jpg;  The monstrous spider, its red eyes glowing ominously in the darkness, lay in a state of slumber, its massive form casting a long shadow over the cave.  "I don't think it's the type to attack unless you enter its territory first... and it looks like it ate a lot and is sleeping right now." a voice observed.  "It should be okay for now as long as you don't provoke it."  the voice added,  a cautious note creeping into its tone.
20.27.A.jpg;  The two adventurers, their expressions a mixture of frustration and concern, stood in the cave, the blue crystals reflecting their uneasy faces.  "But... you said this was your first raid?" the character in blue jacket questioned. "And it's Sung Jin-woo's first time in a C-rank dungeon as well." he added, his words echoing the growing sense of apprehension.  
20.27.B.jpg;  The man, his dark hair and stubble framing his open smile, seemed unconcerned by the situation. "Trust my words." he said.  "Okay?" he added, his eyes twinkling with a hint of amusement. 
20.28.A.0.jpg;  The two adventurers, their faces etched with worry, stood in a cavernous area, their voices echoing in the darkness.  "Do you think anything would happen, when we are talking in loud voices like this for some time already?"  the character in blue and black jacket asked. 
20.28.A.1.jpg;  The two adventurers, exhausted and weary, stood amidst the glittering crystals. "I have something to say to the others as well, so we'll go and have a smoke." the character in black and blue jacket said.  
20.29.A.jpg;  The character in blue jacket, his eyes wide with concern, looked towards the group of characters entering the cave.  "By regulation, C-rank gates must be entered with at least 10 people." he said.  "Excepting Yoo Jin-ho and me, the squad's members are 8." he added, his brow furrowed in thought. 
20.29.B.jpg;  The character with dark hair and a beard smiled, his eyes gleaming with a mischievous glint.  "You know how hard it is to bring a healing hunter to a personal attack force." he said.  "We always did it this way." he added, his words hinting at a long-held tradition.  
20.30.A.jpg;  The two adventurers, their expressions relaxed and content, stood in the cavernous area, the blue crystals reflecting their calm demeanor.  "That means they've entered C-rank gates like that, enough to tell me they've always done it this way." the character with dark hair and a beard said.  "Gyu-hwan." he added, his gaze shifting towards the character with long black hair. 
20.30.B.jpg;  The character with dark hair and a beard, his eyes glowing with a red light, smiled with an air of determination.  "Of course, there would be no need to fill up two empty spots." he said.  "Block the boss room's entrance." he commanded, his words carrying a weight of authority.
20.31.A.jpg;  The two adventurers, their faces a mixture of shock and disbelief, stood in the blue and white area, their expressions reflecting the unexpected turn of events.  "?." a single question mark hovered above them,  the silent symbol of their confusion.
20.31.B.jpg;  The black hole, its swirling blue and white lines a testament to its immense power, hung in the air, a dangerous presence that threatened to consume all that came near.  A lone arm, gripping a shield,  was visible on the left,  a  reminder of the danger that lurked within.  
20.32.A.jpg;  The explosion, a brilliant flash of orange and yellow light,  erupted in the center of the image, its power and destructive force radiating outwards,  a  testament to the chaos and danger that had just unleashed. 
20.32.B.jpg; The man with brown hair, his white shirt a stark contrast to the surrounding landscape, stood with his mouth agape, his face a mask of shock and surprise. "Huh, huuh?!" he exclaimed, his eyes wide with disbelief, his words echoing the confusion that gripped him. 
20.33.A.jpg; The entrance to the cave, its large opening beckoning with a misty allure, stood bathed in a blue and white glow.  "T... the entrance!!" a voice whispered, the words carrying a weight of anticipation and wonder.
