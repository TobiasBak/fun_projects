31.0.A.0.jpg; why are you on the bed?
31.0.B.0.jpg; i'm just acting, since we are married after all!
31.0.C.0.jpg; hmph!
31.0.D.0.jpg; it's all your fault calling me your wife in front of all the p-
31.0.E.0.jpg; she's really cute when she's shy!
31.0.F.0.jpg; i'm only saying all of this so that i can keep all the thirsty guys off your back, you attract attention too easily... 
31.1.A.0.jpg; then i thank you for that. Ah, don't worry, we are married after all. 
31.1.B.0.jpg; argh, do you want to commit murder in this marriage?
31.1.C.0.jpg; get off!
31.1.D.0.jpg; tssh, i'd be dead even if i tried to hide from her. 
31.1.E.0.jpg; don't you feel a little tired?
31.2.A.0.jpg; this thing can make whatever i draw a reality. 
31.2.B.0.jpg; i wonder what limits are there to creating objects?
31.2.D.0.jpg; She is looking up slowly.
31.2.E.0.jpg; The character is standing quietly.
31.2.F.0.jpg; The person's eye glares intensely.
31.3.A.0.jpg; The woman quickly strikes with the sword.
31.3.C.0.jpg; and why are you in my dorm!
31.3.D.0.jpg; The woman stands near the window, a sword in her back.
31.4.A.0.jpg; is this a stone statue of me?
31.4.B.0.jpg; where did this come from... 
31.5.A.0.jpg; She looks surprised.
31.3.B.0.jpg; who are you? the woman with white hair asks, holding the sword tightly. She looks up at the shadowy figure.
31.3.E.0.jpg; huh? she says, looking surprised. The woman lies on the bed, her expression a mixture of confusion and shock.
31.4.C.0.jpg; ! the woman on the floor exclaims, looking ahead. She is surprised to find herself on the floor.
31.5.B.0.jpg; this must be the idiot's doing! she says angrily.
31.5.C.0.jpg; The woman stands in the middle of the room, looking at the destruction around her. She looks at the large cannon and the tipped-over fridge.
31.5.D.0.jpg; The woman looks around the room and asks, what are these weird shapes?
31.5.E.0.jpg; i must've been tired yesterday. He probably made such a loud noise, and even then, i didn't wake up... , she cries softly.
31.6.A.0.jpg; She quickly walks down the hallway and turns the doorknob. it's okay. I'll just call my sister. I'll tell her to give me some more money, she says to herself.
31.6.C.0.jpg; The woman walks quickly away from the man on the ground. The man with blue hair looks curiously at the car.
31.7.B.0.jpg; look over there! she says, pointing quickly. The robot walks slowly and steadily towards them.
31.7.C.0.jpg; i'll deal with you severely when you get home this evening! the woman with white hair shouts.
31.8.A.0.jpg; huh huh huh, a few people mumble.
31.8.B.0.jpg; it's late already, why is xiang ye not here yet? the muscular man asks curiously.
31.8.C.0.jpg; teacher, would you like me to go call him? the boy asks politely.
31.8.D.0.jpg; no need, let's begin classes.  the man says seriously.
31.8.E.0.jpg; i'm so sorry i'm late!
31.8.F.0.jpg; The bell rings loudly.
31.9.A.0.jpg; He rides his bike quickly down the road.
31.9.B.0.jpg; The man rides quickly past them.
31.9.C.0.jpg; xiang ye, what is that thing? the boy asks curiously.
32.0.A.0.jpg; xiang ye, what is that thing? the boy asks again.
32.0.B.0.jpg; is this some sort of new rich kid's toy? how am i supposed to explain this to them? he shouts.
32.0.C.0.jpg; this is my new invention, it's called a bicycle, it can also be called a peddle bike. 
32.1.A.0.jpg; i've only ridden a horse carriage and the dwarf tribe's steam engine before. 
32.1.B.0.jpg; but it's the first time i'm seeing a human powered mode of transportation! hehehe...  he says excitedly.
32.1.C.0.jpg; xiang ye, xiang ye! he exclaims in surprise.
32.1.D.0.jpg; can we try it please? he asks tentatively.
32.1.E.0.jpg; of course! go for it! he replies enthusiastically.
32.2.A.0.jpg; plop the man lands on the bike awkwardly.
32.2.B.0.jpg; sorry about that, i couldn't control myself...  he apologizes sheepishly.
32.2.C.0.jpg; it's alright, we can wait! he says kindly.
32.2.D.0.jpg; xiang ye, how do you use this thing? he asks curiously.
32.2.E.0.jpg; let me hold you so you can find your balance.  he offers helpfully.
32.3.A.0.jpg; put both of your feet down on the pedals and push forwards! uhh... Ahh...  he tries to follow the instructions.
32.3.B.0.jpg; uh... Uh... Take it slowly, pedal with your left and then follow it up with your right.  he explains patiently.
32.3.C.0.jpg; argh! i'm going to fall! ahh! he shouts as he tumbles off the bike.
32.3.D.0.jpg; xiang ye, you're incredible, this thing is really hard to operate! it's difficult initially, but once you've gotten the hang of it, you'll be able to ride it with ease.  he says encouragingly.
32.3.E.0.jpg; use a little more strength and go a bit faster. Find your balance too! he instructs.
32.4.A.0.jpg; just like that! he exclaims proudly.
32.4.B.0.jpg; xiang ye, what are you doing? don't worry about it, you've got to learn through experience! he explains calmly.
32.4.C.0.jpg; yeah! go teacher! they cheer excitedly.
32.4.D.0.jpg; Uhh... Uh... He struggles to maintain balance.
32.4.E.0.jpg; He moves slowly forward, looking down at the handlebars.
32.4.F.0.jpg; Xiang ye, i think i got a hang of it! he laughs.
32.5.A.0.jpg; He's got the technique down already.
32.5.B.0.jpg; this bicycle thing is great! he exclaims excitedly. this invention will probably influence many generations to come!
32.5.C.0.jpg; Just wait until i 'invent' the combustion engine, he chuckles.
32.5.D.0.jpg; xiang ye, how do you stop this thing? he asks worriedly.
32.5.E.0.jpg; fuck! i forgot to draw brakes onto the damn thing! he yells frantically.
32.5.F.0.jpg; what did you say? they ask curiously.
32.6.B.0.jpg; Slam! the birds land on the branch.
32.6.C.0.jpg; sorry about that, i played around for too long, he says apologetically.
32.6.D.0.jpg; it's all the teacher's fault...  he exclaims in shock.
32.6.E.0.jpg; such a great invention, now destroyed...  he sighs sadly. i wanted to observe it so i could make my own... 
32.7.A.0.jpg; really? he asks curiously. what are you waiting for? draw it already! he urges.
32.7.B.0.jpg; i can't draw it now, he says sadly.
32.7.C.0.jpg; i expended the gold alloy stone already, he explains quietly.
32.7.D.0.jpg; what! they exclaim in surprise. you used the whole stone in an evening?
32.7.E.0.jpg; that stone was sufficient to construct an entire house...  he says excitedly.
32.7.F.0.jpg; hehehe, i was experimenting last night with the pen, he says sheepishly.
32.8.A.0.jpg; obviously, i couldn't tell them what i was drawing, he explains with a smile. the pen functions by thought. 
32.8.A.1.jpg; you only need to draw a simplistic drawing to create what you want, he muses.
32.8.A.2.jpg; But the teacher said that a high-level gold alloy stone was needed to create larger structures without any input material.
32.8.A.3.jpg; this entry-level stone needs the same amount of material from the world to create my items, he says. the first thing i drew was a phone. 
33.0.A.0.jpg; She sits on the balcony, looking out at the water.
33.0.A.1.jpg; but the phone i created was unusable, he admits.
33.0.A.2.jpg; because i simply don't know the mechanisms that allow a phone to function, he explains thoughtfully.
33.1.A.0.jpg; This was followed by a tv, fridge, car, etc. , all unusable.
33.1.B.0.jpg; so, you drew a bunch of experimental creations, he teases.
33.1.C.0.jpg; what sort of things did you draw? he asks curiously.
33.1.D.0.jpg; haha, don't worry about it, they were all flops, he says smiling.
33.2.A.0.jpg; The group quickly lines up for forgery class.
33.2.B.0.jpg; He smirks at his reflection in the mirror.
33.2.C.0.jpg; what's up with that face? he asks, looking down. The picture frame falls quickly.
33.2.D.0.jpg; He holds the case open quickly.
33.2.E.0.jpg; He holds the case open quickly. It has the power to defy fate.
33.2.F.0.jpg; The hand presses the button on the staff, and a blue light surrounds it.
33.3.A.0.jpg; we're almost out of stones, one says.
33.3.B.0.jpg; please use them conservatively, another replies while handing a thin wooden rod to a boy.
33.3.C.0.jpg; fantastic, i can continue my experimentation, he says with a smug smile.
33.3.D.0.jpg; i ask you all to practice drawing because it makes you all better forgers. Today, i'll teach you all how to tell the difference between different gold alloy stones, and their uses.  the students quickly sit down in their seats.
33.3.D.1.jpg; sit down, sit down!, sit down, the teacher is about to begin his lecture.   one quickly looks at another.
33.4.A.0.jpg; The hand firmly grasps the metal handle.
33.4.B.0.jpg; He carefully opens the large, orange suitcase.
33.4.C.0.jpg; the world is waiting.  the hand presses the button, and the box quickly opens.
33.4.D.0.jpg; activate.  the toolbox slides open, revealing the metal knives and a silver ring.
33.4.E.0.jpg; The case has three layers, each filled with different tools and liquids.
33.5.A.0.jpg; The toolbox is full of glowing blue discs and paintbrushes.
33.5.B.0.jpg; do you know why we put the stones into pens instead of using them straight as they are for our forging needs? he holds a pen up and smiles.
33.5.C.0.jpg; it's because the power of the stones is too great, using them as is will be difficult to control.  one nods in agreement.
33.5.D.0.jpg; it'll also harm the user.  he looks concerned.
33.5.E.0.jpg; that's right.  the man nods slowly.
33.6.A.0.jpg; two decades ago, i used to visit the dwarf tribe often to improve my craft...  he smiles while looking at a reflection.
33.6.B.0.jpg; A man with long hair stands before a group, holding a weapon.
33.6.C.0.jpg; they already embedded the stones within hammers to use as forging tools. The items that were forged from this tool were beautiful yet durable, but the user would suffer bodily harm.  the hammer glows with purple light.
33.6.D.0.jpg; afterwards, i thought of maturing the stones so that they could be used on smaller tools.  he speaks seriously.
33.6.E.0.jpg; after large amounts of research, i found a great way of controlling the stone's powers.  he stands confidently.
33.7.A.0.jpg; creating objects by drawing them. This is the root of forgery? why do i feel like as if something is lacking? he looks confused and a little troubled.
33.7.B.0.jpg; teacher, where do the gold alloy stones come from? one raises his arm and asks a question.
33.7.C.0.jpg; there is a stone mine in the east border of the capital. All the stones we use originate from there.  he answers calmly.
33.7.D.0.jpg; teacher, i heard that the mine is also the golden dragon's area of residence.  one raises his hand and speaks with surprise.
33.8.A.0.jpg; that particular dragon is dangerous compared to other organisms. That's right, that's right.  one looks at another, seemingly concerned.
33.8.B.0.jpg; if we kill the dragon, doesn't that mean we can acquire a large pile of these stones?! he sweats nervously.
33.8.C.0.jpg; this is why his majesty specifically tasks the purple dragon team to gather the materials.  he explains calmly.
33.8.D.0.jpg; they're responsible for bringing back the stones and refining them. They sell them afterwards for military funding.  he looks to the side, thinking.
33.8.E.0.jpg; The hand grabs a small, glowing blue object from a tray.
33.9.A.0.jpg; this stone here costs around 10 golden coins. Woah! that's expensive! so, every day, we carry 10 gold coins with us.  they all look shocked at the price.
33.9.B.0.jpg; modo, what can i get with one gold coin? one rests his arm on another's shoulder and asks a question.
33.9.C.0.jpg; one gold coin can be exchanged for 10 silver coins. Aren't you the genius! one smiles proudly while the other beams happily.
33.9.D.0.jpg; how much food can you get for a gold coin? how many people would it feed? he asks with a mischievous grin.
33.9.E.0.jpg; one gold coin will be enough for about fifty bags of food, but one bag is sufficient for an adult for an entire month.  he smiles knowingly.
34.0.A.0.jpg; one gold coin is equal to fifty bags of rations, that means it's enough for fifty people to eat for a single month...  he looks shocked at the realization.
34.0.B.0.jpg; The young man looks worried and sweaty.
34.0.C.0.jpg; which means that you expended 500 people's monthly worth of rations in a single night! one smiles while another frowns in disapproval.
34.0.D.0.jpg; these crystalline stones are the lowest tier of gold alloy stones.  he holds up a gem for all to see.
34.0.E.0.jpg; crystal stones are the lowest of the low, medium level stones go up to fifty gold coins for a single stone.  he shows two shiny, crystal stones.
34.1.A.0.jpg; these stones have 3 of the lower tiered stones combined together. The magic aspect stacks and the stone contains three times the magical power of the lower tiered stones. The only benefit of having these is that they work a bit more efficiently than the lower tiered stones. They do have an extra function which allows them to be priced at a higher rate.  he smiles knowingly.
34.1.B.0.jpg; but we don't really find the need for the extra function.  he looks to the side, smirking slightly.
34.1.C.0.jpg; these here are the high tiered gold alloy stones.  the spheres shine brightly in the display case.
34.1.D.0.jpg; these must be expensive! high tier... The middle tier is already worth 50 gold coins...  they look surprised at the prospect of the high-tier stones.
34.2.A.0.jpg; at some rare intervals, they tend to find these high tiered stones. The aqua-coloured stone is called the aqua-magical stone, it's priced at 100 gold coins.  he points to the sphere in the glass box.
34.2.B.0.jpg; 100! they all look surprised at the price.
34.2.C.0.jpg; the aqua-magical stone has water and wood properties. You can use any scrap wood to forge items that result in high-quality wood. This is generally used for the repair of wooden items. This purple stone is called the purple-bolt stone, it harnesses the element of electricity. The stone can use strokes to cut down items, it can also be used to calibrate items that are out of sync. The value of this stone is 300 golden coins.  the spheres of light showcase different properties.
34.2.D.0.jpg; i haven't seen this much money in one place since birth! is the teacher rich? he looks around in disbelief, sweating slightly.
34.3.A.0.jpg; these expensive items aren't used very often! he explains calmly.
34.3.B.0.jpg; rich magicians would embed these three stones on the top of their staff and would use them as substitutes when their magic runs dry. The fire-crystal stone summons balls of fire. The purple-bolt stones can summon thunderstorms. The aqua-magical stone can summon waves of water.  he explains, looking thoughtful.
34.3.C.0.jpg; so, even someone without boundary force can manipulate magic like magicians if they use those stones! now, i'm going to start talking about the pale-moon stone that's on my pen.  he gestures towards his pen, explaining the next topic.
34.3.D.0.jpg; these are considered ultra-rare alloy stones, within the entire human tribe, i am the only one that holds this stone.  he beams with pride.
34.4.A.0.jpg; this thing must be worth at least ten thousand golden coins! i think you're right! they all look amazed at the value.
34.4.B.0.jpg; this stone doesn't need any input material to forge items through drawing...  he explains, looking intrigued.
34.4.C.0.jpg; if i could own a stone like that... I could probably take over this entire world! hehe...  he laughs, imagining the possibilities.
34.4.C.1.jpg; you're the only one.  the woman offers grapes to the man on the throne.
34.5.A.0.jpg; when i was young, i studied forgery with the dwarves... The dwarf tribe is a very shut off location.  he looks back on his past while standing in a barren landscape.
34.5.A.1.jpg; they tend to not communicate with any other tribes.  a blonde woman addresses a group of men.
34.5.A.2.jpg; but they saw the determination for knowledge within me and took me in as one of their students.  a man gently touches a woman's head in a gesture of acceptance.
34.6.A.0.jpg; we also invented a new method of forgery together. The dwarf tribe only has four of these pale-moon stones.  the book glows faintly, illuminating the scene.
34.6.A.1.jpg; because of my achievements, i was rewarded with one of the stones.  one hands a shiny object to another in a dimly lit room.
34.6.B.0.jpg; i'm gonna die! one looks at another in shock and fear.
34.7.A.0.jpg; woah, that stone must've been a really expensive gift! if the stone is that powerful, doesn't this mean that the dwarf tribe is more powerful than the demon tribe?! he ponders the implications of the stone's power.
34.7.B.0.jpg; the power of the pale-moon stone is infinite, it does not require any input material to forge to your hearts' content.  he explains with open arms, emphasizing the stone's incredible ability.
34.7.C.0.jpg; But the price to pay for using the stone is that it will extract consciousness from the user.
34.7.D.0.jpg; Consciousness...
34.7.E.0.jpg; Teacher, if you're built like that, the effects of the stone shouldn't be that effective on you.
34.8.A.0.jpg; Our teacher suffered greatly for the benefit of the kingdom.
34.8.B.0.jpg; Look at the photo on the wall.
34.8.C.0.jpg; The man in the photo is really handsome, what does he have to do with the teacher? why? why?
34.8.D.0.jpg; You guys don't seem to understand.
34.9.A.0.jpg; That's the same teacher from ten years ago!  what?
34.9.B.0.jpg; No way! how is he similar to the teacher apart from the eyebrows?
34.9.C.0.jpg; He's right, that is me.
34.9.D.0.jpg; He stands before the crowd.
35.0.A.0.jpg; A man stands at the bottom of the stairs.
35.0.B.0.jpg; He looks straight ahead.
35.0.C.0.jpg; He sighs.
35.0.D.0.jpg; The carriage is stationary.
35.1.A.0.jpg; He opens a door.
35.1.B.0.jpg; You're...
35.1.C.0.jpg; Father!
35.1.D.0.jpg; He runs towards the carriage.
35.1.E.0.jpg; What's wrong, father?
35.2.A.0.jpg; He looks serious.
35.2.B.0.jpg; Did they hurt you?
35.2.C.0.jpg; He slaps the person's cheek. Leave me.
35.2.D.0.jpg; It's all over! everything is over!
35.2.E.0.jpg; Over...
35.3.A.0.jpg; All over...
35.3.B.0.jpg; Father... Hahaha...
35.3.C.0.jpg; What did they do to you?
35.3.D.0.jpg; Hahaha! no one can change it! hahaha...
35.3.E.0.jpg; Huh! huh! huh! huh!
35.4.A.0.jpg; She stands ready to fight.
35.4.B.0.jpg; The person is out of focus.
35.4.C.0.jpg; She moves quickly.
35.4.D.0.jpg; She spins, swinging her sword.
35.4.E.0.jpg; She runs, deflecting arrows.
35.5.A.0.jpg; She swings her sword, deflecting arrows.
35.5.B.0.jpg; She stands amidst broken arrows. Well done!
35.5.C.0.jpg; The woman with black hair smiles.
35.5.D.0.jpg; She covers her face.
35.5.E.0.jpg; I was already better than this before, it's just that i feel more fatigued now when in motion.
35.6.A.0.jpg; She hums thoughtfully.
35.6.B.0.jpg; Remember to practice some more when you leave here.
35.6.C.0.jpg; You study swordsmanship for half the time compared to these guys.
35.6.D.0.jpg; Understood, i will practice hard.
35.7.A.0.jpg; Wait, you're not...
35.7.B.0.jpg; !
35.7.C.0.jpg; Miss dorona and miss wadley?
35.7.D.0.jpg; What are you both doing in my dorm room?
35.7.E.0.jpg;... Huh?
35.7.F.0.jpg; The hand grasps the arm.
35.8.A.0.jpg; They're stone statues!
35.8.B.0.jpg; Is it good?
35.8.C.0.jpg; How did you give color to the stone statues?
35.8.D.0.jpg; In the future, i'll create many more things that you've never seen before!
35.9.A.0.jpg; The hand moves a sheet of paper.
35.9.B.0.jpg; What's all of this?
35.9.C.0.jpg; Oh, these are what teacher martin gave me.
35.9.D.0.jpg; It's blueprints of what he brought back from the dwarf tribe!
36.0.A.0.jpg; The woman holds the orb.
36.0.B.0.jpg; It seems like the knowledge of the dwarves has already surpassed the demon tribe by miles. They already discovered the steam engine and its application in trains.
36.0.C.0.jpg; The teacher saw that i was interested in experimenting with new ideas, so he gave these blueprints to me.
36.0.D.0.jpg; Ah! the woman kicks the man.
36.0.E.0.jpg; With you creating all these structures, aren't you afraid of exposing your identity? why would i be afraid, none of the people in this world know what i'm forging anyways.
36.1.A.0.jpg; Ahahah... The hand holds the man's ear.
36.1.B.0.jpg; What was with that statue next to the bed yesterday? i would wear such expressions, what are you hinting at here?
36.1.C.0.jpg; I just wanted to see if i could make drawings come to life...
36.1.D.0.jpg; If you had tried it already, why would you make these statues too then?
36.1.E.0.jpg; I wanted to experiment with colors...
36.2.A.0.jpg; Hmph, you're just human trash!
36.2.B.0.jpg; Let me explain...
36.2.C.0.jpg; Bang!
36.2.D.0.jpg; The next day, he has a serious expression.
36.2.E.0.jpg; I've already figured out the steam engine.
36.3.A.0.jpg; If i can alter the design, i might be able to make myself a car!
36.3.B.0.jpg; And if i keep on developing it, maybe...
36.3.C.0.jpg; One day, that lady will know my full strength and potential, hahaha...
36.3.D.0.jpg; Huh? he looks to the right.
36.4.A.0.jpg; What are we going to do... I don't know...
36.4.B.0.jpg; So you were the one who stole from me.
36.4.C.0.jpg; Xiang ye!
36.4.D.0.jpg; What happened here?
36.4.E.0.jpg; Our teacher went into the gold alloy mine!
36.4.F.0.jpg; Last night, the teacher and i went to the purple dragon team's base to purchase some stones.
36.5.A.0.jpg; But we didn't know that the prices were raised!
36.5.A.1.jpg; What did you say? all alloy stone prices are increasing threefold?
36.5.A.2.jpg; That's right, but if it's teacher martin shopping for these stones... I'll draft.
36.6.A.0.jpg; The gold alloy stones are the most important resource to the kingdom, if the prices inflate, how are forging smiths supposed to survive? that's right, we have followed teacher martin's pricing advice to keep prices low for the people.
36.6.B.0.jpg; But, the price of the stones was fixed by the purple dragon group's leader, he said that he wouldn't change... That was the old leader, he's been marked as a traitor since.
36.6.C.0.jpg; Do you all want to die miserably just as he did?
36.7.A.0.jpg; Mister martin, you all have been living within the heart of the kingdom for too long, everything that happens outside the kingdom is simply oblivious to you. His majesty's troops are currently attacking the eastern tribe, we need heavy...
36.7.A.1.jpg; Like funding at a time like this. If we can increase the prices for the stones, you too, can increase the prices for your services.
36.7.B.0.jpg; It's all that we can do.
36.8.A.0.jpg; And after that, the teacher went to brave the mine on his own.
36.8.B.0.jpg; I heard you all talk about dangerous creatures within the mine. Would the teacher be able to take care of himself?
36.8.C.0.jpg; I've never seen the teacher fight before... Me neither...
36.8.D.0.jpg; He's only a forging teacher, how would he be able to defeat a dragon?!
36.8.E.0.jpg; The teacher already thought that the prices for the stones were high, we didn't know that the prices of the stones were going to increase! he's suffering again for the benefit of the kingdom's people...
36.9.A.0.jpg; We need to stop him at all costs!
36.9.B.0.jpg; I'm going to go find the swordsmanship teacher and the magic teacher to help us...
36.9.C.0.jpg; Teachers with classes aren't here today. Why not?
36.9.D.0.jpg; The kingdom hosts an annual spring hunt. Prior to the hunt, the teachers have to visit his highness to receive the rules for the year.
36.9.E.0.jpg; Did it have to be today of all days? yup...
37.0.A.0.jpg; Then i'm going to go find sophisas.
37.0.B.0.jpg; No can do. A large portion of the hunting is organized by the white dragon team!
37.0.C.0.jpg; I can't do this. I can't do that. What the fuck am i supposed to do!
37.0.D.0.jpg; We can't have an innocent soul like him getting hurt!
37.0.E.0.jpg; Uh... Is this an earthquake?
37.1.A.0.jpg; The man has a serious expression.
37.1.B.0.jpg; Good morning, elder! good morning, eli.
37.1.C.0.jpg; 
37.1.D.0.jpg; It's him!
37.2.A.0.jpg; The boulder falls.
37.2.B.0.jpg; Cough, cough...
37.2.C.0.jpg; This is the materials for this month.
37.2.D.0.jpg; Eli, mister martin has left for the time being, can he give you the money for the materials after he's returned?
37.2.E.0.jpg; No worries, i've got loads of faith in him!
37.3.A.0.jpg; I'm going now!
37.3.B.0.jpg; The hand grips a white object.
37.3.C.0.jpg; Eli, do you want to earn some more money? oh, it's xiang ye!
37.3.D.0.jpg; Modo, take me to the purple dragon group, i want to buy a high-level gold alloy stone!
37.3.E.0.jpg; What do you want to buy stones for?
37.4.A.0.jpg; Several men stand before a large building.
37.4.B.0.jpg; I'm sorry.
37.4.C.0.jpg; Did that martin cross straight in from here? that's right.
37.4.D.0.jpg; Hehe, he said that he wanted to collect stones on his own.
37.4.E.0.jpg; Haha, that idiot, he's going to get himself eaten by that dragon.
37.4.F.0.jpg; He is an academy teacher after all, he must have a few tricks up his sleeve.
37.5.A.0.jpg; Even if he did defeat that dragon, don't forget that he's going to have to get past us first.
37.5.B.0.jpg; The person spins, generating electricity.
37.5.C.0.jpg; Huh?
37.5.D.0.jpg; Hey, look at that.
37.5.E.0.jpg; What is that thing?
38.0.A.0.jpg; The man draws a line on the floor.
38.0.B.0.jpg; Shit! what kind of monster is that? it's coming straight for us!
38.0.C.0.jpg; Woah!
38.0.D.0.jpg; There's a monster appearance within the kingdom walls, let our leader know!
38.1.A.0.jpg; The vehicle accelerates.
38.1.B.0.jpg; Woah! can't you slow it down a little... Is this the thing that you created from those steam engine blueprints? hehe...
38.1.C.0.jpg; This is a car, and i've added some improvements.
38.1.D.0.jpg; I've made the thing electric!
38.1.E.0.jpg; Electric? are you telling me that you bought purple-electric stones to power this thing?
38.2.A.0.jpg; That's right, you're a smart one!
38.2.B.0.jpg; I'm going to have to count on you guys to rescue mister martin!
38.2.C.0.jpg; Ahhh! xiang ye, pay attention to where you're going!
38.2.D.0.jpg; Look at where you're going and don't look back!
38.2.E.0.jpg; Sit tight, i'm about to speed it up!
38.3.A.0.jpg; Five figures stand outside the gold alloy stone mine.
38.3.B.0.jpg; Huh?
38.3.C.0.jpg; Oi, who are you and what are you doing here?
38.4.A.0.jpg; I want to collect alloy stones to take back to the school so i can teach my students.
38.4.B.0.jpg; Our leader has already set rules in place, only people from the purple dragon group may collect resources from this mine...
38.4.C.0.jpg; You dare defy us? hey! let him go, what is he going to achieve from going in there alone?
38.4.D.0.jpg; The man looks to the right.
38.5.A.0.jpg; The man casts a spell.
38.5.B.0.jpg; As long as i follow the dug-out route, i should be able to find some stones.
38.5.C.0.jpg; Hmm?
38.5.D.0.jpg; There seems to be many minerals in this mine.
38.6.A.0.jpg; The guy still said that gathering these stones was difficult. They only said so that they could raise the asking price of the stones!
38.6.B.0.jpg; Drip drip drip.
38.6.C.0.jpg; Don't worry, i'll be fine.
38.6.D.0.jpg; The man moves his hand towards the creature.
38.7.A.0.jpg; Ground dragon!
38.7.B.0.jpg; Crack!
38.7.C.0.jpg; The animal charges towards the man.
38.7.D.0.jpg; The man clenches his jaw.
38.7.E.0.jpg; The car drives up the cliff, leaving a trail of smoke.
38.8.A.0.jpg; Xiang ye! the cave entrance is just up ahead.
38.8.B.0.jpg; A vehicle approaches the cave entrance.
38.8.C.0.jpg; We didn't see the teacher on the way here. He must've already gone in!
38.8.D.0.jpg; Ugh...
38.8.E.0.jpg; My tolerance for things like this has definitely weakened!
38.9.A.0.jpg; Huh?
38.9.B.0.jpg; Are you alright? we still have to fight in a moment!
38.9.C.0.jpg; I-it's alright... I'll be fine after a short rest.
38.9.D.0.jpg; Yi bei, do you think you can handle the ground dragons?
38.9.E.0.jpg; At the demon tribe, the citizens used to eat them roasted!
38.9.F.0.jpg; Then let's go find our teacher!
38.10.A.0.jpg; A white circle glows brightly.
38.10.B.0.jpg; Whirl!
38.10.C.0.jpg; Shit! what's going on?
38.10.D.0.jpg; The man looks off panel.
38.10.E.0.jpg; Time...
38.10.F.0.jpg; Whee!
38.11.A.0.jpg; Teacher!
38.11.B.0.jpg; Huh?
38.11.C.0.jpg; Why are you all here?
38.11.D.0.jpg; Teacher, are you hurt?
38.11.E.0.jpg; Hehe, it's all good.
38.12.A.0.jpg; The large creature lies on its back.
38.12.B.0.jpg; Teacher...
38.12.C.0.jpg; Is that a gun? is that a gun?
38.12.D.0.jpg; Gun? this is a steam ejector invented by the dwarves.
38.13.A.0.jpg; That's wonderful!
38.13.B.0.jpg; We can go collect our own stones in the future and we will never need to buy them from the army ever again!
38.13.C.0.jpg; We can't use them yet, they still need to be refined.
38.13.D.0.jpg; There's a refinery class in the school. I'm pretty sure we can ask them for help.
38.13.E.0.jpg; If you've said it, the teacher has probably thought about it already.
39.0.A.0.jpg; If i was to take a guess, that refinery teacher works with the purple dragon team!
39.0.B.0.jpg; Yup...
39.0.C.0.jpg; We've got company!
39.0.D.0.jpg; It's purple dragon troops!
39.0.E.0.jpg; Woah! there's many here!
39.1.A.0.jpg; I don't understand.
39.1.B.0.jpg; It doesn't look like these people are willing to share...
39.1.C.0.jpg; Hmph! you've got some balls, martin!
39.1.D.0.jpg; Don't you know that this area is under the watch of the purple dragon team? teacher, who is this? he's the refinery teacher at the academy, he's also the refinery practitioner of the purple dragon team, yalu!
39.2.A.0.jpg; Yalu, i thought that collecting resources was supposed to be a dangerous thing to do.
39.2.B.0.jpg; Those ground dragons can't even be considered hostile! i mined all of that on my own!
39.2.C.0.jpg; You people created lies to up your prices!
39.2.D.0.jpg; The people within the kingdom are struggling workers, they have to save up twenty to thirty years' worth of pay so that they can have a roof over their head. And you're selling low tier stones at the price that an average person earns over twenty to thirty years! why are you doing this?
39.2.E.0.jpg; Damn, isn't this just like my original world? i didn't know that buying a house here was just as hard!
39.3.A.0.jpg; I will inform his majesty of this, we will not be needing you for our supply of gold alloy stones any longer!
39.3.B.0.jpg; Hmph, even if his majesty allowed you to mine for your own stones, how are you going to refine them for your own uses?
39.3.C.0.jpg; It's all my fault that i didn't stay long enough to master the arts of refinery from the dwarves. I left in a hurry!
39.3.D.0.jpg; So what if we don't know how to refine them?
39.3.E.0.jpg; After leaving here today, we'll head to the dwarf tribe to master the technique! but...
39.4.A.0.jpg; Is a military budget the actual reason for you to increase the prices of the stones? this kid...
39.4.B.0.jpg; All you greedy bastards are responsible for the high prices inside the capital!
39.4.D.0.jpg; Do you even know the people who are supporting what we're doing out here?
39.4.E.0.jpg; I thought i'd let you off easy. But now, i'm going to bury you here forever!
39.5.A.0.jpg; Stop. You want to live.
39.5.B.0.jpg; It's all my fault, i didn't know that i would be putting all of you in danger too!
39.5.D.0.jpg; 
39.5.E.0.jpg; That's right, but it's all my fault for being too rash. I brought them all here to help.
39.5.F.0.jpg; Thank you everyone!
39.6.A.0.jpg; Go!
39.6.B.0.jpg; A man stands as another rides a contraption.
39.6.C.0.jpg; Eli, yi bei!
39.6.D.0.jpg; Do you guys still remember the plan? i remember, we need to clear out a large area for you!
39.6.E.0.jpg; Don't!
39.7.A.0.jpg; The woman holds a sword.
39.7.B.0.jpg; You're not a match for me.
39.7.C.0.jpg; Two fists collide.
39.7.D.0.jpg; Focus, focus, focus!
39.7.E.0.jpg; That's what i'm talking about!
39.8.A.0.jpg; Shockwave!
39.8.B.0.jpg; The machine emits white smoke.
39.8.C.0.jpg; Boom!
39.8.D.0.jpg; You won't live long.
39.9.A.0.jpg; Argh ahh!
39.9.B.0.jpg; They're too strong! are they really students?
39.9.C.0.jpg; I didn't know that the teacher was this powerful...
39.9.D.0.jpg; Xiang ye, how do you still have time to draw? i'm experimenting!
39.9.E.0.jpg; If i get this right, forgery may become the new strongest branch at our academy!
40.0.A.0.jpg; Wind!
40.0.B.0.jpg; Electricity!
40.0.C.0.jpg; Huuaahh!
40.0.D.0.jpg; This is the power of my bloodline.
40.1.A.0.jpg; Several explosions happen on the ground.
40.1.B.0.jpg; The woman is fighting against the men.
40.1.C.0.jpg; Ah, my foot! ah...
40.1.D.0.jpg; The woman looks over her shoulder.
40.1.E.0.jpg; Hehe...
40.2.A.0.jpg; The man stands against a blue background with white lightning bolts.
40.2.B.0.jpg; What's this stuff?
40.2.C.0.jpg; A foot steps on glowing green substance.
40.2.D.0.jpg; The liquid swirls around the foot.
40.2.E.0.jpg; A powerful sorcerer...
40.2.F.0.jpg; Hmph!
40.3.A.0.jpg; You think you can do that? you've really gotten cocky.
40.3.B.0.jpg; The man throws punches surrounded by green energy.
40.3.C.0.jpg; The man's eye glows.
40.3.D.0.jpg; The hand punches forward with a green blur.
40.3.E.0.jpg; The hand is clenched into a fist with green trails swirling around it.
40.4.A.0.jpg; This stuff moves on its own...
40.4.B.0.jpg; Hugnnn...
40.4.C.0.jpg; Eli!
40.4.D.0.jpg; Fist of heat!
40.4.E.0.jpg; The green slime flows off the person's arms.
40.5.A.0.jpg; This stuff is resistant to fire!
40.5.B.0.jpg; This is my hand-brewed animated slime, it's fire and shock proof!
40.5.C.0.jpg; Let's try something different!
40.5.E.0.jpg; The man is summoning magic energy.
40.6.A.0.jpg; You're not allowed to leave this place.
40.6.B.0.jpg; Mr. Martin! that liquid was corrosive!
40.6.D.0.jpg; Hehe...
40.6.E.0.jpg; I did say that this was where you were going to die!
40.6.F.0.jpg; Ugh...
40.7.A.0.jpg; Do you think i'd be afraid of you?
40.7.B.0.jpg; That was beautiful!
40.7.C.0.jpg; Hehe...
40.7.D.0.jpg; You're too weak to fight.
40.8.A.0.jpg; The woman runs, generating glowing green lines.
40.8.B.0.jpg; Green liquid has splashed onto the ground.
40.8.C.0.jpg; The slime is dripping down the man's face and body.
