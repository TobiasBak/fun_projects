51.0.A.0.jpg; My back is sore. The man looked down and the woman looked to the right.
51.0.B.0.jpg; Thanks, you two. The man in the purple robe spoke to them.
51.0.C.0.jpg; Do your best martin! gotcha. The woman smiled excitedly.
51.0.D.0.jpg; See you again. The man with spiky blue hair waved goodbye.
51.1.A.0.jpg; Eli, there are ten days left before the competition. Aren't you going to go practice? the man asked the other.
51.1.B.0.jpg; Teacher said that working here counts as training towards the competition. He smiled, pushing a large grey rock with his bandaged hand.
51.1.C.0.jpg; How broke are you? i heard that you've been moving materials for the forgery class since forever. The man's mouth opened slightly in shock.
51.1.D.0.jpg; Eli is a great kid. He's got many siblings at home. The man pointed upwards. A large rock was being lifted.
51.2.A.0.jpg; And sends the money back to his family to help with the expenses. He pushed the cart with two large pots on it quickly.
51.2.B.0.jpg; Not only is he a great student, he's a great brother too! hehe, i am the oldest one after all. The boy smiled warmly and gave a thumbs up.
51.2.C.0.jpg; Winning the tournament can result in greatly improving the quality of life for my siblings! he looked down determinedly.
51.2.D.0.jpg; So i must win this time round! he flexed his fist.
51.2.E.0.jpg; Is there a lot of prize money involved? he touched his chin thoughtfully.
51.2.F.0.jpg; Of course! the man with blue hair looked to the left.
51.3.A.0.jpg; The winner takes home a thousand gold coins and a pure gold tournament cup! he pointed his finger up excitedly.
51.3.B.0.jpg; Tsh, that's only enough to buy a few high-level gold alloy stones. He frowned.
51.3.C.0.jpg; Apart from that, you're also awarded with an honorary military title! after graduating, you can directly join the military and earn a fortune! he smiled excitedly.
51.3.D.0.jpg; Military title? can they leave the kingdom to venture outwards? his mouth opened in surprise.
51.3.E.0.jpg; Of course you can, but leaving alone is very risky. He looked to the left.
51.3.F.0.jpg; Hey! that way i can take yi bei and head back to the demon tribe! i've been away for so long now, if i don't get back before my vacation ends, i'm screwed! but if i go back... He looked serious.
51.4.A.0.jpg; Head over there. Alright. Take the blueprint and wait for my commands. Sure. The man pointed to the kneeling man, who drew lines in the sand.
51.4.B.0.jpg; Teacher! he spoke.
51.4.C.0.jpg; We're here. The man with teal hair smiled.
51.4.D.0.jpg; I'm so glad that you guys could lend a hand! he smiled.
51.4.E.0.jpg; As a student, helping the teacher is a must. They stood facing a large wall.
51.5.A.0.jpg; Senior hans! modo! the three men smiled and spoke.
51.5.B.0.jpg; I can't believe that the three seniors are all here! the man in the red coat held something.
51.5.C.0.jpg; So you must be xiang ye. He looked surprised.
51.5.D.0.jpg; I heard that you can draw mechanical giants and steam engines. How did you manage that? he looked to the left.
51.6.A.0.jpg; Hehe, it's not much, i just have a big brain... He scratched his head smugly.
51.6.B.0.jpg; But you guys seem to be even more impressive, i heard modo say you guys are well known forgers within the kingdom! that's right! he smiled and held his hand to his head.
51.6.C.0.jpg; I asked them to come so that they could help you guys improve your forgery skills while i'm busy. He looked directly at the viewer.
51.6.D.0.jpg; I want you guys to enter special training within the next ten days! special training? the man with brown hair looked shocked.
52.0.A.0.jpg; Xiang ye, you once spoke of craftsmen fighting alongside soldiers in battles. The man looked at the boy seriously.
52.0.B.0.jpg; To be honest, i dislike the idea of fighting, but the dwarves have taught me one important lesson. He looked to the right.
52.0.C.0.jpg; Large amounts of force can start battles, but they can also equally end them at the same time. A hand rested on the young man's shoulder.
52.0.D.0.jpg; I hope that you'll understand what i'm trying to convey. He smiled.
52.0.E.0.jpg; I understand! he looked forward.
52.1.A.0.jpg; Students, let me introduce you to these three seniors. They are my best students. The man in a teal outfit pointed at the three seniors.
52.1.B.0.jpg; Within the next ten days, they will be taking over my classes and help everyone master forging techniques. The man with teal blue hair gestured with his hand.
52.1.C.0.jpg; This is hans, some of you might have already met him before, he is currently the most talented architect within city walls! pleased to meet you! he stood seriously.
52.1.D.0.jpg; Mohan, our best weapons' specialist. I wouldn't say that's the truth. He smiled.
52.1.E.0.jpg; Kaiser, our best clothing designer. Hey y'all. He waved his hand.
52.2.A.0.jpg; They will assist you in specializing for the next ten days! understood! he looked down slightly.
52.2.B.0.jpg; In previous tournaments, the craftsmanship branch has always achieved sub-par results. He wore a teal and yellow outfit.
52.2.C.0.jpg; We're hoping that you'll break this curse. He smiled slightly.
52.2.D.0.jpg; Every class will send out five students to contest within the tournament. We won't be aiming for the cup, but we have to achieve a good score! he looked serious.
52.2.E.0.jpg; Let's all try our best! hohoho! i've got to step up my game too! he lifted a large rock.
52.3.A.0.jpg; Magic class training grounds. The figures stood rigidly.
52.3.B.0.jpg; The man walked forward. The figures walked forward.
52.3.C.0.jpg; The man released energy from his hand.
52.3.D.0.jpg; The man summoned a large wave of blue energy.
52.3.E.0.jpg; A blue energy beam cut through the air.
52.4.A.0.jpg; The figure was surrounded by a blue and white aura.
52.4.B.0.jpg; The man held out his right hand.
52.4.C.0.jpg; A hand reached forward with glowing yellow sparks.
52.4.D.0.jpg; The figure was engulfed in a bright yellow light.
52.4.E.0.jpg; Destroy. The man held his hand forward.
52.5.A.0.jpg; The monster walked to the right, the ground glowing.
52.5.B.0.jpg; You're kidding. An arm punched forward.
52.5.C.0.jpg; You... The man held a ball of flames.
52.5.D.0.jpg; The man extended his arm, shooting fire.
52.5.E.0.jpg; The humanoid stood with its mouth open, radiating energy.
52.6.A.0.jpg; The humanoid was surrounded by flames.
52.6.B.0.jpg; A bright golden tornado swirled.
52.6.C.0.jpg; Several grey rocks fell from the sky.
52.6.D.0.jpg; Rennes is really powerful! he's not even in the same league as me, but we've got the cup in the bag. The women stood outside.
52.6.E.0.jpg; Teacher, if rennes is so good why don't we just enter him solo into the tournament... The girl with pink hair smiled.
52.6.F.0.jpg; Can't do, i don't want dorona to take second place either! the girl with pink hair looked to the right.
53.0.A.0.jpg; A large waterfall cascaded down the canyon.
53.0.B.0.jpg; Is this... ? the woman with purple hair sat in the waterfall.
53.0.C.0.jpg; Yi bei's sword skill has already refined to excellent level. She stood on a dirt path.
53.0.D.0.jpg; But i still need her to project her boundary force! he looked serious.
53.1.A.0.jpg; The woman looked down.
53.1.B.0.jpg; What's this? she appeared to be in shock.
53.1.B.1.jpg; Don't worry. The woman looked down at the group.
53.2.A.0.jpg; These are all my generals! who did this? she looked up in shock.
53.2.A.1.jpg; The woman stood with her arms out.
53.2.A.2.jpg; Don't be afraid, i'm the queen, and i'm you! the woman held another woman's chin.
53.3.A.0.jpg; The person behind this massacre is... You! the person smiled. The hand curled into a claw.
53.3.A.1.jpg; Me? that's right, they suffered and gave up their lives. The woman with horns placed her hand on the other woman's shoulder.
53.3.A.2.jpg; Gave of their energy because you were too weak and naive! it was me... You trusted the humans because you were weak! you trusted lilian because you were naive! the woman with horns spoke smugly.
53.4.A.0.jpg; No, that's not true! the woman in blue ran away.
53.4.B.0.jpg; This wasn't my fault! i just didn't want to see more beings perish. I didn't know it would lead into the pointless sacrifice of my people! the woman spoke with distress.
53.4.B.1.jpg; Royal father's idea of consuming the lands was wonderful! she looked sinister.
53.4.B.2.jpg; Royal father? but you ruined the work of the oz tribe! even after all that, your followers still innocently sacrificed their lives to protect a queen like you! the woman with yellow shirt stood beside the woman with horns.
53.5.A.0.jpg; You've already forgotten who you were! the woman stared.
53.5.A.1.jpg; Your highness... Your highness... Your highness... The man reached out, swarmed by goblins.
53.5.A.2.jpg; Your highness... Your highness... Your highness... Your highness... I... The woman with purple hair stood with her arms outstretched.
53.5.A.3.jpg; I don't need you to remind me! the woman yelled.
54.0.A.0.jpg; You're so strong. The female character looked up in surprise.
54.0.B.0.jpg; The person ran away from a wave of water.
54.0.C.0.jpg; Shit! the man looked at the viewer.
54.0.D.0.jpg; The water cascaded down on the woman.
54.1.A.0.jpg; The woman sat with her eyes closed, the red circle expanding.
54.1.B.0.jpg; Such powerful boundary force! the woman stood with a shocked expression.
54.1.C.0.jpg; I am the goddess of creation. The woman sat in a meditative position.
54.1.D.0.jpg; The person ran.
54.1.E.0.jpg; The woman screamed.
54.2.A.0.jpg; That was close, i almost got consumed by her boundary force. Her aura is so strange... The woman with white clothing held her head.
54.2.B.0.jpg; He's seen boundary force like this before, its evil intent makes his blood run cold.
54.2.C.0.jpg; The tubes hiss.
54.2.D.0.jpg; The blue liquid sizzles and overflows.
54.3.A.0.jpg; The blue liquid bubbles.
54.3.B.0.jpg; He says yalu.
54.3.C.0.jpg; Is there a reason as to why he's been called here?
54.3.D.0.jpg; The man points and says the bastard doesn't even address him as a teacher.
54.3.E.0.jpg; Using this stuff, he might even be able to beat rennes. What? are you for real? of course.
54.3.F.0.jpg; He says he has a condition.
54.4.A.0.jpg; He wonders how his forgery is coming along.
54.4.B.0.jpg; Wah, so handsome. The women stare at him.
54.4.C.0.jpg; He says martin didn't belittle him.
54.4.D.0.jpg; The man says yi bei is trying hard too.
54.4.E.0.jpg; He asks if the mistress prepared all this.
54.5.A.0.jpg; He asks what it is.
54.5.B.0.jpg; He pulls the string.
54.5.C.0.jpg; He asks what the things are.
54.5.D.0.jpg; He says it's called a fan.
55.0.A.0.jpg; He says all you need to do is pull the string.
55.0.B.0.jpg; He says it's fun.
55.0.C.0.jpg; It rings.
55.0.D.0.jpg; There are many strange things on the streets.
55.0.E.0.jpg; He asks what the things are.
55.1.A.0.jpg; Come on in, come on in! woah, the prices have finally dropped. You're right. Wauh, he wants that.
55.1.B.0.jpg; We're selling bicycles, two gold coins each! me too, i want one! i want a red one!
55.1.C.0.jpg; He demands ten.
55.1.D.0.jpg; He says the place is busy.
55.1.E.0.jpg; She says why is she still learning magic.
55.1.F.0.jpg; He says bicycles are better.
55.2.A.0.jpg; He says bulk sale, dorona, wadley, come quick! who's got the courage to bulk sell academy teachers?
55.2.B.0.jpg; There are even more people there.
55.2.C.0.jpg; Two gold coins for one, three coins for two.
55.2.D.0.jpg; The more you buy, the cheaper it gets. Woah, he wants it! he'll have one! he wants both.
55.2.E.0.jpg; They're figurines of the two teachers.
55.2.F.0.jpg; He asks how much for the one behind him.
55.3.A.0.jpg; Our boss said it's a unique 1:1 scale of the real thing, the starting price is two thousand gold coins.
55.3.B.0.jpg; Woah, that's too expensive, but he really wants it.
55.3.C.0.jpg; He asks if the boss is xiang ye.
55.3.D.0.jpg; Oh oh, it's mr. General, welcome! you're right, his boss is mr. Xiang ye. So it was the kid!
55.3.E.0.jpg; This entire street is filled with mr. Ye's new inventions! he's really incredible.
55.4.A.0.jpg; Honk-honk. They look to the right.
55.4.B.0.jpg; Ha ha ha. The crowd looks at the truck.
55.4.C.0.jpg; Is that a monster? that's xiang ye's steam-powered car.
55.4.D.0.jpg; The streets are really crowded.
55.4.E.0.jpg; Hey, it's team leader.
55.4.F.0.jpg; Team leader waves at the people.
55.5.A.0.jpg; He smirks.
55.5.B.0.jpg; A large stone coliseum stands in a vast field.
55.5.C.0.jpg; This way, this way. Careful.
55.5.D.0.jpg; The arena is almost complete.
55.5.E.0.jpg; This is the work of a truly talented crafter. Thank you for the compliments.
55.5.F.0.jpg; He says xiang ye is gone with eli.
56.0.D.0.jpg; He asks what they're going to the lumber forest for.
56.0.E.0.jpg; He says they didn't say.
56.0.F.0.jpg; He says xiang ye wanted them to give him a chest of gold.
56.0.G.0.jpg; Woah, is this the money xiang ye made?
56.1.A.0.jpg; That's right, it's his donation to the military fund.
56.1.B.0.jpg; This is the hard-earned money of the citizens.
56.1.C.0.jpg; You're mistaken, captain.
56.1.D.0.jpg; Now they can mine this on their own.
56.2.A.0.jpg; And also the combat class' help, every second of this is considered practice!
56.2.B.0.jpg; The cost of craftsmanship has come to an all-time low.
56.2.C.0.jpg; He holds a small green stone.
56.2.D.0.jpg; Mr. Yalu used to refine them for five gold coins, it's been changed to two coins. Refining cost of five gold coins? that's a rip-off! he heard the regent demanded a price change.
56.2.E.0.jpg; Then the cost of living should decrease too.
56.3.A.0.jpg; That's right, the cost of living has decreased.
56.3.B.0.jpg; Is that so?
56.3.C.0.jpg; We're here! so this is useless lumber?
56.3.D.0.jpg; Yup.
56.4.A.0.jpg; He's a little nervous.
56.4.B.0.jpg; The texture doesn't match up to wood at all.
56.4.C.0.jpg; One man adjusts his shirt, the other adjusts his satchel.
56.4.D.0.jpg; He says he wants to test the wood.
56.4.E.0.jpg; He reaches into his bag.
56.5.A.0.jpg; The hands hold a black bucket.
56.5.C.0.jpg; You need to be stronger.
56.5.D.0.jpg; Begin transfer!
56.5.E.0.jpg; The object glows yellow.
56.5.F.0.jpg; The first.
56.6.A.0.jpg; The man stands in front of a glowing rock.
56.6.B.0.jpg; Powerful. The rock splits in half.
56.6.C.0.jpg; He smiles.
56.7.A.0.jpg; And add an electric alloy stone!
56.7.B.0.jpg; Using transfer scrolls saves time.
56.7.C.0.jpg; It's all up to you now!
56.7.D.0.jpg; Whiz whiz.
56.8.A.0.jpg; Hngh...
56.8.B.0.jpg; The way it is.
56.8.C.0.jpg; The useless lumber is really hard!
56.8.D.0.jpg; Two white objects clash.
56.8.E.0.jpg; Eh, even a steel chainsaw wouldn't cut it down.
56.9.A.0.jpg; It didn't even make a dent.
56.9.B.0.jpg; It's great!
56.9.C.0.jpg; He asks why they're harvesting it.
56.9.D.0.jpg; He says they only consider it useless because they can't build houses.
56.9.E.0.jpg; But that's because the material was used in the wrong places!
56.9.F.0.jpg; But if they use it in the right places, it can become a valuable resource!
56.9.G.0.jpg; It's christmas!
57.0.A.0.jpg; A large stone colosseum stands outside.
57.0.B.0.jpg; Whoa!
57.0.C.0.jpg; Hush. Small pieces of red and green paper float in the air.
57.0.D.0.jpg; The man stands straight with his arms at his side. Small red and green shapes float in the air.
57.1.A.0.jpg; The king of all worlds. He stands seriously with six others.
57.1.B.0.jpg; Cheers. The woman looks down.
57.1.C.0.jpg; That's what you get. The woman stands in front of four soldiers.
57.1.D.0.jpg; the dragon is not here, and he will not come.  i am your emperor, and i am here to protect you.  he stands at the top of the stairs.
57.2.A.0.jpg; i'm just trying to save my brother from the wrath of the dragon.  everyone looks up.
57.2.B.0.jpg; The woman smiles.
57.2.C.0.jpg; the kingdom cup tournament shall now commence! he yells loudly.
57.2.D.0.jpg; please may the academy representatives enter the arena! he stands with his arms crossed.
57.2.E.0.jpg; i wonder which class is going to win this year? it's either going to be swordmanship or magic! the boys talk.
57.3.A.0.jpg; that's not set in stone, the combat class almost won last time.  they look at the door.
57.3.B.0.jpg; magic class representatives! the girl sits on the orb.

57.4.A.0.jpg; swordsmanship class representatives! the woman stands with a sword.
57.4.B.0.jpg; they even have a royal candidate! she smiles smugly.
57.4.C.0.jpg; who's that girl behind dorona? didn't expect someone this pretty this time round! she looks seriously.
57.4.D.0.jpg; Stop. She shoots a bolt of lightning.
57.4.E.0.jpg; Yi bei! she stands still.
57.5.A.0.jpg; don't hold back this time.  he looks to the left.
57.5.B.0.jpg; She closes her eyes.

57.7.A.0.jpg; let's go everyone.  yeah.  yeah.  the boy talks.

57.7.D.0.jpg; ohoh! that's the chef class represen-tative! isn't that teacher old wood! what's going on? is the chef class partici-pating too? hahaha! they look surprised.
57.8.A.0.jpg; Huh. Huh. Huh. They stand on a staircase.
57.8.B.0.jpg; what is a chef going to compete with? a frying pan? hehehe...  they smile.
57.8.C.0.jpg; nainai, relax, you always want to control your fire when you cook! he frowns.
57.8.D.0.jpg; hahaha, did you hear that, he sounds just like a little girl! u-understood teacher! hahaha, he's a large built man called nainai! they laugh.
57.8.E.0.jpg; Huh. He is surrounded by black energy.

58.1.E.0.jpg; one of the categories is cross country, this lasts for a full day.  he stands with his back to the viewer.
58.1.F.0.jpg; A green circle glows in the room.
58.2.A.0.jpg; Elemental. A pillar glows faintly in the arena.
58.2.B.0.jpg; the long run takes part within the kingdom walls. It passes through five locations. The starting point is the lake of sound! a blue circle with a star glows.

58.3.B.0.jpg; they've selected the most grueling places this time round! isn't that a bit too difficult...  they look worried.
58.3.C.0.jpg; there will be a portal after every section of the event.  he looks at the viewer.
58.3.D.0.jpg; passing through all the portals will score you points according to your position. But, also hidden in every location are ten kingdom tokens.  his cloak flows.
58.3.E.0.jpg; every token can be redeemed for ten points.  he holds a golden coin.
58.4.A.0.jpg; only sixteen of the participants that pass all five locations with the highest points can proceed into the next stage of the tournament.  he looks pale.
58.4.B.0.jpg; there is danger all around you within all the locations. You need to give indemnity prior to your departure.  he looks to his right.

59.0.E.0.jpg; An ocean stretches out before them.
59.1.A.0.jpg; strange, is this really a lake bed and not a sea? he looks worried.
59.1.B.0.jpg; do you know why this place is called the lake of sound? he looks towards the right.
59.1.C.0.jpg; if you yell at the edge of the lake, it echoes for a longer than average period of time! he looks towards the right.
59.1.D.0.jpg; and that's why it's adopted that particular name.  he is surprised.
59.1.E.0.jpg; really? let me try! he smiles widely.

59.4.D.0.jpg; of course i do! some people can be really annoying, hitting on a girl when they know she's married! hmph! she frowns.

59.5.C.0.jpg; hehe, glad to see you still rely on me to chase thirsty guys away! he smiles happily.
59.5.D.0.jpg; huh? he looks surprised.
59.5.E.0.jpg; what's wrong? why does she seem so weird recently? he looks concerned.
59.5.F.0.jpg; He stands on the shore.

59.9.B.0.jpg; He stands with his arms crossed.

60.1.E.0.jpg; will you please take us? there's so much space, we'll help you row too.  she pleads.
60.2.A.0.jpg; uhm...  he looks to the right.
60.2.B.0.jpg; we already declined the idea in the first place. Why don't you try and cross the lake instead of trying to sway these guys.  she speaks loudly.
60.2.C.0.jpg; y-yeah, you guys are on your own. My head went blank for a moment and i almost agreed...  he blushes.
60.2.D.0.jpg; hmph, it's all that tomboy from the archery class' fault.  she looks to the right.
60.2.E.0.jpg; brother, it's all up to you now.  she stands beside him.

60.3.B.0.jpg; He extends his hand.

60.4.B.0.jpg; woah, that's some pretty magic! he looks in awe.
60.4.C.0.jpg; that's not magic, it's a summoning skill! summoning skill? he looks surprised.
60.4.D.0.jpg; beast [hawk eye].  the owl descends.
60.5.A.0.jpg; it seems like i really was blessed by the ancient gods! haha, we needed a flying beast! she smiles happily.
60.5.B.0.jpg; They fly over the ocean.
60.5.C.0.jpg; sister, do we need to speed up? we don't know what traps are up ahead, let them lead the way.  they fly over the water.

60.5.E.0.jpg; let's head out, general! he smiles.
60.6.A.0.jpg; i don't want to go in the water! the cat looks down.
60.6.B.0.jpg; but, if you don't want to swim, how are we going to get to the finish line? he smiles.
60.6.C.0.jpg; that's something you needed to consider as a leader, i don't want to go into the water! so, you're saying that you can't swim... When did i say that i could swim? he sits on the cat-like animal.
60.6.D.0.jpg; jeez, am i going to be eliminated in the first round? he looks down.
60.6.E.0.jpg; you're finally here.  she stands and looks to the right.
60.7.A.0.jpg; so how are we going to cross the lake? she smiles.
60.7.B.0.jpg; we don't know any magic and we don't have mythical creatures either, we can only rely on our tools! he kneels and looks at the map.
60.7.C.0.jpg; please retreat by a few steps.  he sits on the ground.
60.7.D.0.jpg; He stands in the light.
60.7.E.0.jpg; He sits and looks at the rock.
60.8.A.0.jpg; he's using an expensive transfer scroll to transfer a boulder...  she looks shocked.

60.8.C.0.jpg; xiang ye.  he thinks.
60.8.D.0.jpg; why don't you draw mark 3? he looks at him.
