21.1.A.0.jpg;  He calmly explains that his Battlefield Insight ability, ranked B and copied from Sarbast Aegim, allows him to instinctively feel the battlefield's flow, discerning advantages, disadvantages, and weak points. "It is a skill that lets one have insight over the battlefield. Whether my allies are at an advantage or disadvantage, the strengths and weaknesses of my enemies, and where weak points are in their defense - these can be instinctively felt. *Skill copied from NPC Sarbast Aegim. This is the 'ability' I created." 
21.1.A.1.jpg;  Excitedly, the man with brown hair explains the route, "If you keep going straight and then take a right, you'll find the demon army's general. There are some monsters around, but it'll be okay. Just wipe them out." The knight, looking determined, responds, "Ooh! Understood!" 
21.1.B.0.jpg;  A screen displays a map with red and blue dots, a red and gold flag waving hopefully in the foreground. "The Goddess's hero will protect us!!" is displayed above the screen.
21.1.B.1.jpg;  Four knights on horseback charge forward resolutely, ready for the battle ahead. 
21.1.C.0.jpg;  Knights on horseback surround a group of goblins on the ground, the air thick with anger. "You fucking goblin shits! Wipe them out! A skill that lets me pretend to be a military expert and gain the trust of the general."
21.1.C.1.jpg;  Pointing confidently at a large screen depicting the battlefield, the brown-haired man declares, "Ah, turn right here! Of course, this skill is only super effective thanks to the minimap."
21.1.D.0.jpg;  The man watches with frustration as a goblin, wooden staff in hand, plummets from the sky. "And the knowledge from having repeated this day a few times."
21.1.D.1.jpg;  He rides his horse with unwavering determination, knights blurring behind him. "Hey, that goblin is flying away today as well."
21.2.A.0.jpg;  He raises a hand, the shining sword in his grasp radiating power. "Skill isn't everything, though."
21.2.A.1.jpg;  His eyes widen in awe as he holds a silver sword before a golden frame proclaiming "Laefanta Aegim's Holy Sword of Protection Rarity: Legendary." "It's the light of the Goddess!"
21.2.B.0.jpg;  A short-haired man kneels, receiving a sword from a winged woman bathed in light. "'The Holy Sword of the Founder'. Legend says that a goddess gifted it to the founder of the Aegim empire. Before history became a legend, the founder went missing, and the holy sword also" 
21.2.B.1.jpg;  The blonde woman, wings spread, looks down solemnly as she and a dark-haired man pray amidst a crowd. "Sword also vanished, only leaving behind a prophecy. 'When the fateful day arrives, the one wielding the holy sword shall also arrive.' The one who possesses the holy sword of protection will receive absolute trust and support from the people of the Aegim empire." 
21.2.C.0.jpg;  Dark clouds part as if in reverence, a voice booming through the sky, "It's the founder's holy sword... Ahh, God has not abandoned the empire! All hail the empire! All hail the hero!"
21.2.C.1.jpg;  He rides triumphantly atop his horse, glowing sword held high, the armored men below gazing up in admiration. 
21.2.D.0.jpg;  With fierce determination in his eyes, the brown-haired man raises his hand, a glint of light reflecting off it. "Attack!"
21.2.D.1.jpg;  The black-haired man pumps his fist in the air, a wide grin on his face. "Good. Really good. It was worth clearing the hidden stage, since I got to see this sight!"
21.2.E.jpg;  Red-faced and furious, the man yells, his anger almost tangible. "What do you mean, worth it?!? You traded it for a shitty ass item!"
21.3.A.0.jpg;  A green-haired man leans over the red-haired man's shoulder, a smug grin on his face. "It's just a hard and shiny fucking sword!!!"
21.3.A.1.jpg;  He stares at the glowing green screen, utterly perplexed. "There were a lot of epic items, so why did you pick that one?!"
21.3.B.0.jpg;  He holds up the sword, his eyes gleaming with self-satisfaction. "It's durable, shiny, and makes all the NPCs up to floor 20 go nuts over it. Do you get it? NPCs aren't just tools"
21.3.B.1.jpg;   He charges forward on horseback, blue glowing sword raised high, leading a group of armored warriors. "That give out quests."
21.3.C.0.jpg;   Five warriors stand at attention, swords drawn, their expressions grim. "They are entities that should be used to beat quests!"
21.3.C.1.jpg;   A lone warrior kneels, offering his sword in reverence. "Oh hero!!! Please look over us!!!"
21.3.D.jpg;  Three men watch, intrigued, as the general walks by.  "Why is he the only one with the general...? From his appearance, he looks like a hunter..."
21.3.E.jpg;   He stands with his eyes closed, a blissful smile on his face, oblivious to the judgement. "This is exactly it. That voice of envy and jealousy! I taught you aura, yet instead of practicing your swordsmanship, you're using it to strengthen your ears for listening in on people babbling?!?"
21.3.F.jpg;   A map displays a scattering of blue dots across a mountainous terrain. "So what if I like it? Sue me! The left wing of the demon army has been annihilated!"
21.3.G.jpg;  He raises his glowing sword, his excitement palpable. "Don't stop, and keep charging towards their main forces!"
21.4.A.0.jpg;  With a determined cry, the white-haired man charges into battle, a green monster falling before him. "We can win!"
21.4.A.1.jpg;  A blonde swordsman soars through the air as a man with an eyepatch rallies the troops. "Follow the general! Follow the hero!"
21.4.B.0.jpg;  A shadowy figure wielding a spear stands amidst a group of startled, multi-armed monsters. "He's the demon army general... Huh?!?"
21.4.B.1.jpg;  Two hulking, goblin-like creatures, clad in purple and gold, brandish a massive black staff, their faces contorted in rage. "Floor 11 boss monster Goblin Emperor"
21.4.C.jpg;  The monstrous creature, eyes blazing with fury, swings its staff towards a lone rider. "'Stop them! You idiots!' Gogoruk! Goru!"
21.4.D.0.jpg;  He lunges towards the blue-caped creature, silver sword flashing. 
21.4.D.1.jpg;  He stands tall, energy crackling around him as he prepares to unleash his power. "[Activating skill]"
21.4.E.0.jpg;  A furious roar echoes across the battlefield. "Go ru ruk!!!!!!"
21.4.E.1.jpg;  His sword glows brightly as he strikes a powerful blow against the blue-caped creature. "[Goblin High Society] Rank: F"
21.5.A.0.jpg;  The purple-caped creature lies defeated, surrounded by the bodies of its fallen comrades. 
21.5.A.1.jpg;  Three riders on horseback gallop across a cracked and barren landscape, their mission nearly complete. 
21.5.B.0.jpg;  A sword pierces the air, framed by the victorious red and blue flags. "We defeated the evil monsters!!!"
21.5.B.1.jpg;  He stands amidst the cheering crowd, the weight of their adulation heavy on his shoulders. "The Goddess's hero defeated the enemy's leader!!"
21.5.C.jpg;  A single word rings out, filled with pride and fervor: "Long live the Aegiim empire!!!"
21.5.D.jpg;  Inside a dimly lit cave, a goblin clutches his head, his agonized cries echoing off the stone walls. "Keruk... keruru..."
21.5.E.jpg;  He watches in bewilderment as a horde of small, green creatures swarms the battlefield. "Hmm?"
21.5.F.jpg;  Three figures stand amidst the chaos, their expressions a mixture of anger, amusement, and confusion. "Would you look at these little shits?"
21.5.G.0.jpg;  He and the woman fight back-to-back against the relentless goblin horde. "Solo hunting is our area of expertise. Kill them all!"
21.5.G.1.jpg;  Silence descends upon the battlefield, littered with the bodies of vanquished goblins. "[Stage cleared!] [Today, the floor 11 stage was cleared.]"
21.6.A.0.jpg;  They stare at the screen, their faces a mixture of disbelief and elation.  "We beat floor 11 in one day?! Is this for real!!! [Assessing raid participants...] [Assessment complete]"
21.6.A.1.jpg;  They erupt in joyous celebration, their victory hard-earned and well-deserved. "Aren't we too fucking strong?! [Maximum number of participants exceeded.] Long live the Black Dragon Guild!!!"
21.6.B.0.jpg;  A screen flickers to life, displaying the rankings for the raid.  "[Announcing the top 10 participants.] [Raid contribution ranking] 1. Kim Gong-ja 2. Sword Saint 3. Heretic Inquisitor 4. Viper 5. Paladin"
21.6.B.1.jpg;  They crowd around the screen, their expressions shifting from excitement to puzzlement. "6. Black Witch 7. Countess Huh? 1st place doesn't have an alias? Sword Saint is ranked 2nd?"
21.6.C.0.jpg; Kim Gong-ja is the one who cleared floor 10!!! 
21.6.C.1.jpg;  The man in the black jacket walks confidently forward as the two men beside him watch in surprise. 
21.6.D.jpg; The red-haired man looks thoughtful. "Is he like a hidden master or something?"
21.6.E.jpg;  He glares down at the other man in annoyance. "Master, my ass. He's just a smart ass wimp." The other man smiles. "Do you finally admit that this is a godly game of skill?" 
21.6.F.jpg;  "Nope! I refuse to acknowledge it!" He walks away angrily as the other man, who he thinks is a ghost, watches. 
21.6.G.jpg; He looks straight ahead confidently. "Really values one's abilities over skills."
21.6.H.jpg;  "I promise to practice some swordsmanship before I clear floor 20, so stop pouting." He smiles at the red-haired man who simply replies, "Really?"
21.7.A.0.jpg; The red-haired man looks down in frustration. "Of course. You think that I would waste my chance to learn from the 'sword emperor'? If anything, I should be begging for you to teach me your swordsmanship." 
21.7.A.1.jpg; He grins widely, looking excited.  "Ain't that right!!"
21.7.B.0.jpg; He throws his head back and laughs.  "Zombie, you're finally recognizing my true worth! Too easy." 
21.7.B.1.jpg;  "You know, the tower that you're climbing might be just a smidge different from mine, but in my world-" he pauses, "it's too easy to make this ghost happy." he says with an amused smile. 
21.7.C.jpg; Armored legs stand firmly on the rocky ground. "Oh goddess's hero."
21.7.D.jpg; The man in armor looks down at the other man. "We were victorious thanks to you. Truly, you have my deepest gratitude."
21.7.E.jpg; "It was nothing." he replies, looking down at the armored man. "We won thanks to everyone's hard work."
21.7.F.jpg; The armored man looks down in thought. "I was worried about nothing. Huh?"
21.7.G.0.jpg; A cloaked figure stands before swirling clouds. "Long ago, there was a prophecy". 
21.7.G.1.jpg; A monstrous black creature looms over two men. "One day, the demon army will arrive." the text warns. "However, do not fear, as heroes from another world will also be summoned."
21.7.H.0.jpg; The mustached man narrows his eyes.  "However, I was skeptical."
21.7.H.1.jpg; A hand clad in armor clenches into a fist. "Would those heroes truly fight with all they have for a world that isn't even theirs?"
21.8.A.0.jpg;  "It seemed like it was just an old man's worry. I want to give you a proper thanks." The armored man looks determined. 
21.8.A.1.jpg; He smiles, extending a hand. "A handshake."
21.8.B.jpg; The two men shake hands, the armored man smiling brightly. "I have great expectations of you." "I'll try my best." the other man replies. 
21.8.C.jpg;  [Assessing clear rewards...] The process has begun. 
21.8.D.jpg; [Assessment complete.]  He turns away, the results in. 
21.8.E.0.jpg; [Rewarding top raid contributors.] The excitement builds. 
21.8.E.1.jpg; His eyes widen in surprise as he's suddenly lifted into the air. 
21.8.F.jpg; [The top contributors will be given early entry to floor 12.] The prize is revealed. 
21.8.G.0.jpg; The three people on the platform stare in shock, their expressions a mixture of surprise and disbelief.  
21.8.G.1.jpg;  [Until the top contributors are given their rewards, the remaining participants are banned from entering floor 12.] The announcement causes widespread frustration. 
21.8.H.jpg; "...I." he trails off,  holding out a hopeful hand. 
21.9.A.jpg; Leave the fate of my empire in your hands. A blinding light fills the air. 
22.1.A.0.jpg; He turns away from the colorful light, confused. "Wait, only the top 10 are going to be summoned? Won't old man Marcus also be there?" 
22.1.A.1.jpg; "What are you going to do?" another man asks from behind. "If the old man spots you, he's going to come at you like a madman."
22.1.B.jpg; "Don't worry so much. The worst that can happen is me dying." he says with a determined look. "Are you being for real right now?" the other man asks, incredulous. 
22.1.C.0.jpg; [Transfer complete.]  "I'm saying that it's fine because I have a plan."
22.1.C.1.jpg;  He walks towards the light, his backpack slung over his shoulder. 
22.1.D.0.jpg;  "Is this... Aegim Empire's palace...?" someone breathes. "Oho?"
22.1.D.1.jpg;  "To be summoned to a place like this..." he murmurs, looking around in awe. 
22.1.E.0.jpg;  "Hunter Kim Gong-ja! You were amazing!" the blonde woman exclaims excitedly. 
22.1.E.1.jpg; He continues walking, his expression hardening. "Heretic Inquisitor?" 
22.1.F.jpg; He became younger by using his ability... The truth is revealed. 
22.1.G.0.jpg; "I was quite entertained by your performance on floor 11. To use the NPCs like that!" he gestures with his arm, a smirk on his face. "You were using an unusual sword. Is it perhaps a reward from floor 10?" 
22.1.G.1.jpg; The blonde haired man nods slightly. "Well, yes..."
22.2.A.jpg; The blonde-haired man smirks. "I thought so! Using the floor 10 reward to blitz through floor 11... you've astonished me with how efficiently you use what you've got." 
22.2.B.jpg; "No, well, it's not that amazing..." he says, trying to appear modest despite the smirk on his face. 
22.2.C.0.jpg; The old man gets into a fighting stance, white energy crackling around him. "Holy technique, 'God of Flesh'."
22.2.C.1.jpg; The old man strikes a powerful pose as the blonde-haired man is sent flying through the air. 
22.2.D.0.jpg;  "What a surprise, Sword Saint." he says, staring at the newcomer in shock. 
22.2.D.1.jpg;  "Since when did you become an assassin?" the Sword Saint demands, his hand outstretched. 
22.2.E.jpg;  "Move aside." the Sword Saint commands, his back to the viewer. 
22.2.F.0.jpg; The man with white hair shouted angrily, "i will be killing that man." 
22.2.F.1.jpg;  Standing in the building, he gripped his large silver blade tightly, his face a mask of anger. 
22.2.G.0.jpg; Chapter 22. In a grand hall, a person with black hair placed a comforting hand on the blonde-haired person's chest, asking, "Pardon me, but by 'that man,' do you perhaps mean hunter kim gong-ja?"
22.2.G.1.jpg;  The dark-haired man, clutching his sword, replied, "That is correct." as the man in the blue suit walked briskly away.
22.3.A.jpg; The white-haired man warned, "And if you don't move aside, I will cut off one of your arms in the process."
22.3.B.0.jpg; The blonde-haired person, their back to the others, exclaimed nervously, "That would be quite the pickle! I have a lot of uses for my arm, and if we let hunter kim gong-ja die, the reputation of the 5 great guilds will fall to the ground!"
22.3.B.1.jpg;  The blonde-haired person turned, a confident smile on their face, and asked, "May I please know the reason why you are after hunter kim gong-ja?"
22.3.C.jpg; The white-haired man responded flatly, his face bored, "I have no obligation to tell you."
22.3.D.jpg; Anger and shock crossed the blonde-haired person's face as they questioned, "Does that mean you're not willing to back down, sir?!"
22.3.E.0.jpg; The blonde-haired person held their hands out, confidently summoning a bright magic. 
22.3.E.1.jpg; "Holy technique, 'God of Tele-portation'." materialized across the air.
22.3.F.0.jpg;  Beams of light erupted as the robed man swung his arm toward the other man, who stood ready with his sword.
22.3.F.1.jpg; The white-haired man closed his eyes, his face tilted upwards in a show of formidable power. 
22.3.G.0.jpg;  "Hiyaaaah!!!!" the man in black and red roared as he raised his sword, engulfed in beams of white and blue light. 
22.3.G.1.jpg; Frustration evident on his face, the man in the dark suit slammed his foot down, muttering, "Damn pesky fruit flies..."
22.4.A.0.jpg; Crouching low, the white-haired man glared at the ground, his rage echoing in his words, "You monstrous old man! What do you need to fucking eat to still be this healthy?!" 
22.4.A.1.jpg; "The real young ones would laugh." the white-haired man scoffed as he walked away, "Even you're past your 40s, aren't you?"
22.4.B.0.jpg; "Old, my ass! Life starts in your 40s! How do you not know that?!" the grey-haired man bellowed, ignoring the taunting words, "Celestial clan master! It is true that you are old! Just look at your face!"
22.4.B.1.jpg; Eyes wide with disbelief, the man in the black and red outfit pointed, exclaiming, "That thing is on my team, right?!" 
22.4.C.jpg; "Focus on the fight in front of you, Viper." the white-suited man commanded. "We are at a disadvantage in this fight."
22.4.D.0.jpg;  "Mmm.. " the silver-haired man muttered, glancing down at the smiling blonde woman. 
22.4.D.1.jpg;  "That is certainly true as it stands." the silver-haired man stated confidently as the blonde woman gestured enthusiastically beside him.
22.4.E.jpg; "Countess! Please give me just 10k gold!" the blonde woman pleaded, her face a picture of desperation.
22.4.F.0.jpg; The brown-haired woman offered slyly, "15% compound interest. No interest if completely repaid within 3 months. Does that sound like an acceptable condition?"
22.4.F.1.jpg;  "You've misunderstood my words! I didn't ask to 'borrow'." the brown-haired woman snapped, her hand shooting out accusingly. 
22.5.A.0.jpg;  Exasperation filled the brown-haired woman's voice, "Excuse me! Are you demanding charity from a business person?" 
22.5.A.1.jpg;  "Yes! It's dirty money anyway." the brown-haired woman replied, a self-satisfied smirk on her face, "Donate it to the temple and go to heaven!"
22.5.B.jpg;  The brown-haired woman scoffed, "He's even more of a nasty thief than me."
22.5.C.0.jpg;  The gold skull pulsed with an internal light. "Withdraw. 10k gold." echoed through the hallway.
22.5.C.1.jpg; Gold coins rained down, the blonde woman gazing with wonder as the man in white gloves stared upwards in awe.
22.5.D.0.jpg;  "Thank you for the payment!" the blonde woman cheered, her face alight with joy as coins glittered around her.
22.5.D.1.jpg;  The blonde-haired man basked in his success, standing triumphantly atop his mountain of gold.
22.5.E.0.jpg;  "Holy technique, 'God of Donation'!" the blonde woman proclaimed, her hand glowing as she channeled magic, "Imbuing holy attribute, body strengthening. Buff targets, paladin-Viper."  The grey-haired man smiled with satisfaction.
22.5.E.1.jpg;  "Buff duration, 300 seconds!" the blonde-haired man exclaimed, his mouth agape, "Gold shall grasp our hands. Holy technique complete!"
22.6.A.0.jpg;  "The gold coins are..." the black-haired man trailed off, stunned, as the grey-haired man beside him stared in disbelief.
22.6.A.1.jpg;  The grey-haired man stated firmly, "Starting now, for 300 seconds, Paladin and the Celestial Clan Master will be completely different." 
22.6.B.0.jpg;  "Even if it's you, you'll struggle dealing with me, Countess, Paladin and the Celestial Clan Master! Also, the Countess has yet to run out of money! If you like, we can test out which comes first, your death or the Countess's bankruptcy! Seriously! Why do you have to drag my money into this?" The grey-haired man and the brown-haired woman bickered, their expressions a mixture of challenge and annoyance.
22.6.B.1.jpg;  The purple-haired woman stood tall, her face determined. "Let me add a word of advice." she declared. "There will be more than just 4 going after you. I'm going to make it clear that I will join the fight as well. Hunter kim gong-ja made an official agreement with the 5 guilds yesterday." 
22.6.C.jpg;  "'Agreement'?" the grey-haired man growled, his expression thunderous. "Yep." came a voice from below.
22.6.D.0.jpg;   "Currently, hunter kim gong-ja has joined all 5 guilds with the same status as a guild master." a voice explained. "Therefore, Sword Saint." the voice continued, as the black-haired man listened with concern, "If you point your sword at him, that is akin to pointing your sword at us. Do you really think you can face all of us?"
22.6.D.1.jpg; The man in the suit drew his sword, his expression resolute. "This was the plan I'd come up with."
22.7.A.jpg;  The white-haired man's voice rumbled with barely contained fury, "Do you remember the words I said on floor 11?" 
22.7.B.0.jpg;  "What words?" the red-haired man asked, his brow furrowed in confusion. 
22.7.B.1.jpg;   "There are two ways to fight against a strong opponent." the red-haired man explained, his gaze fixed on the black-haired boy. 
22.7.C.0.jpg;  The white-haired man's voice dripped with icy determination,  "One is to have enough raw power to crush an army by yourself..."
22.7.C.1.jpg; He stood, a figure of ruthless power, his hands outstretched towards the terrified creatures.
22.7.D.0.jpg;  "And the other is to raise an army yourself." the voice finished, and the black-haired boy's eyes gleamed with excitement.
22.7.D.1.jpg; An army clad in metal stood ready, their presence a silent testament to their might. 
22.7.E.0.jpg;  "A solo player is powerless against a hunter in a mighty alliance." the black-haired man murmured, worry etched on his face as he looked towards the sparkling sky.
22.7.E.1.jpg;  Four swords whirled around the white-haired man, his face a mask of grim determination as he prepared to face the coming battle. 
22.7.F.jpg;  A man in black pants stands casually on a wooden floor, facing the viewer. "let's have a conversation." "sir sword saint." 
22.7.G.jpg; Inside, the smiling man with black hair stands confidently with his hands in his pockets while the sword-wielding man in the suit eyes him with apprehension.  "a conversation?" "yes. honestly, i'm shocked by this whole ordeal." 
22.7.H.0.jpg;  The gray-haired man, his bright blue eyes glaring with anger, stands against the white background.  "i don't know why you are attacking." "this may be the first time you've seen me, but i've been a big fan of yours for a while." 
22.7.H.1.jpg;  Indoors, the suited man with gray hair looks down doubtfully.  "he's not buying it." 
22.8.A.0.jpg;  Outside, the gray-haired man hangs upside down, staring intensely at his sword-wielding opponent in the black jacket.  "the sword saint probably still assumes that i'm an assassin sent by the black dragon." 
22.8.A.1.jpg;  The gray-haired man stares up in surprise at his assailant. "to dodge my sword." "you truly are an exceptional assassin!"
22.8.B.0.jpg; A red skull with crossed swords is displayed against a stark white background. "from an outsider's perspective, you're more than just a little bizarre zombie." "and in gramps's eyes, you would most certainly seem like an underling raised by a major guild and not just some upstart hunter." 
22.8.B.1.jpg;  The black-haired man stands mysteriously against the faded black and white background, clutching a silver sword, the number 4093 looming overhead. 
22.8.C.0.jpg;  The gray-haired man, his dark undershirt barely visible, looks up maliciously against the black background.  "in other words..." "scheming together."  
22.8.C.1.jpg;  Indoors, the gray-bearded man in the suit exudes confidence and authority.  
22.9.A.jpg;  A hooded figure with glowing yellow eyes peers from the top left corner of the page, overseeing a call for translators. "reaperscanlations@gmail.com"  "join us! if you enjoy our work" "discord.gg/sb2jqkv"  "patreon.com/"  "" "paypal.me/" 
23.0.A.jpg; The black-haired man, arms crossed, stands confidently beside the red-haired woman, a wall of text behind them hinting at a story about a class of "suicide hunters". "join our discord to get updates in real time at the bottom of the image." 
23.1.A.0.jpg;  A round piece of artwork depicting white flowers within a circle is framed by pillars and visible through a window, a look of disbelief on a hidden character's face. "huh." "the outside world and the babylon really aren't much different."
23.1.A.1.jpg;  The gray-haired man stands seriously in the large room, the light reflecting dramatically off his dark blue suit.  
23.1.B.0.jpg;  The purple-haired character speaks directly to the white-bearded man below as the blonde and brown-haired characters look on seriously.  "to join a guild." "after i entered the tower, you guys pressured me every day." 
23.1.B.1.jpg;  The silver-haired man with an eye patch, dressed in a dark suit with a red sash, locks eyes with the viewer, challenging the figure in silver armor beside him. "however, i firmly rejected your offers. do you all know why?" 
23.1.C.0.jpg;  The purple-haired woman stands powerfully before a door adorned with six shimmering mirrors, her sword gripped tightly in her hand.  
23.1.C.1.jpg;  A hand clad in white clutches a sword, its blade reflecting a blue light, as a declaration hangs below. "in this "tower" i wanted to show people that one could stand on top by himself." 
23.1.D.0.jpg;  A dark tower pierces the blood-red sky above a darkened city, a bold statement emblazoned across the top. "bloodline. nationality. affiliation. unlike the outside world that reeks, tangled up by such lowly things."
23.1.D.1.jpg;  A ray of hope shines from the angular tower in the center of the city, silhouetted against the fiery hues of the setting sun. "one can become the greatest here with just a single sword." 
23.1.E.0.jpg;  The older man, his blue eyes piercing, points urgently out of the frame, emphasizing his point with a serious expression.  "they can succeed with just talent and effort!"  
23.1.E.1.jpg;  The older man in the dark suit jacket yells furiously, his anger palpable.  "i wanted to deliver such hopes to the people! yet, what have you bastards been doing?!" 
23.1.F.0.jpg;  The woman with dark purple hair glares down at someone with fierce anger and disgust.  "you have all already become stagnant moldy mudwater!"  
23.1.F.1.jpg;  The dark-haired woman, dressed in black, stares down sternly, her disgust evident. "how could you, of all people, say such a thing?" 
23.2.A.0.jpg;  Accusatory words hang in the air, tinged with sadness and anger.  "you survived by yourself because you only cared about yourself. had you helped out, many more hunters could have survived! you were the only one to not help with the floor 5 raid!! and floor 7, as well as floor 9! the casualties could have been cut in half if you had just helped, gramps!" 
23.2.A.1.jpg;   The grey-haired man with an eyepatch yells in a fit of rage, his frustration evident in his expression and traditional Chinese attire.  
23.2.B.0.jpg;  Words filled with guilt, disappointment, and a longing for change appear above a head of dark brown hair.  "had you used your outside influence to help, the current food shortage wouldn't have been as bad. that's not all! the current tower society could have been established much more securely!" 
23.2.B.1.jpg;  The woman with long dark hair, wearing a yellow and blue jacket, voices her sadness and frustration. "we're rotting mudwater? if that's true, you are a child without a sense of responsibility!!!"  
23.2.C.0.jpg;  The purple-haired woman, her eyes blazing, glares down fiercely in anger and disgust. "if you are rank 1, display a sense of responsibility befitting that of rank 1!!!!" 
23.2.C.1.jpg;  The purple-haired woman yells downwards, her anger and disgust palpable.  
23.2.D.jpg;  The three women, the central figure with dark purple hair, stand seriously in the shadowy setting, ready to face whatever comes their way. "silence." 
23.2.E.0.jpg;  The white-haired man in the dark blue suit, seated upon his throne, glares angrily at the noisy crowd before him.  "you're all grown adults, yet you can't stop yapping... do you all think i'm your actual grandfather or something?" 
23.2.E.1.jpg;  The white-haired man in the blue suit, a large sword a testament to his power, stands ready to fight. "cut the bullcrap. if you want a fight, fight with your swords." 
23.2.F.0.jpg;  The red-haired man in a white gi strikes a fighting pose, ready to prove himself.  "as expected from gramps! like my one and only disciple!" 
23.2.F.1.jpg;  The red-haired man in the white gi faces the man in the black suit, a large building visible through the window of the ornate room. 
23.2.G.0.jpg;  The determined character in the white suit stands in the futuristic setting, refusing to back down. "you guys still fight even with just 10 people around." "don't retreat! if we are pushed back here, it will be the end for the empire!" 
23.2.G.1.jpg;  The character in the green and black suit despairs as enemies surround them in the dark and gritty setting. "that's impossible! there are too many enemies!" 
23.3.A.0.jpg;  The brown-haired man in the dark gray suit surveys the situation in the room with the dark green tiled floor.  "even the floor 11 npcs came together in order to save their country..." 
23.3.A.1.jpg;  The man in the black clothes stands ready to fight, knife in hand, in the ornate room, as shadowy figures watch from the edges. 
23.3.B.0.jpg;  The purple-haired woman, clad in black and white, looks down intently, her focus unwavering. "hunter kim gong-ja. this has nothing to do with you." "it's about something more serious than you..." 
23.3.B.1.jpg; The purple-haired woman looks worriedly at the ground, her white jacket with a blue fur collar doing little to conceal her somber mood.  "i understand that. i really do."
23.3.C.0.jpg;  The white-haired man in the blue suit stands thoughtfully in the large room, contemplating the situation. "but as hunters, shouldn't we first focus on clearing floor 12? "  "instead of pointing fingers and holding a grudge, shouldn't we act better than the npcs, not worse?"
23.3.C.1.jpg;  Tension fills the large room as the black-haired man in the center, silver knife in hand, reacts to the blue-suited man beside him and the women behind them. 
23.3.D.jpg;  The black-haired man stares in disbelief as the blue-suited, white-haired man stands beside him, revealing a surprising truth. "they're asking for your help." "even if they might be just npcs... !" 
23.3.E.jpg;  The armored man in the red cape stretches out his hand, his expression a mix of despair and hope.  "They say that their nation is on the brink of collapsing." "i leave the fate of my empire in your hands." 
23.3.F.0.jpg;  The white-haired man with the eyepatch, his black robe billowing around him, glares down at someone, sword at the ready.  "how can we, the summoned heroes, put the empire second?" "is there really much to being a hero? if you solve problems that others can't, you're heroes." "...you insolent."
23.3.F.1.jpg;  Determination fills the blue-suited man as he grips his sword tightly, the armored man behind him a silent observer.  "let's focus and clear the rest of the stages like floor 11." 
23.3.G.0.jpg;  The white-haired man and the armored man stand in the throne room, a silent understanding passing between them.  "kim gong-ja is right." 
23.3.G.1.jpg;  The white-haired man in the blue suit gapes in disbelief, his eyes drawn to the armored figure beside him.  "paladin...?" 
23.3.H.jpg;  The armored legs stand firmly on the tile floor as words of contemplation and understanding hang in the air.  "it is hard to understand why the sword saint suddenly attacked kim gong-ja." "but at the very least, it is clear that this is not the time for us to be fighting amongst each other." 
23.4.A.0.jpg;  The armored man in front of the large building dramatically extends his glowing hand. "i'll make a small sacrifice." 
23.4.A.1.jpg;  With a sword secured on their back, the armored figure confidently walks across the red carpet.  
23.4.B.0.jpg;  "everyone, watch closely." a screen flashes, displaying information about the "rank: a-" lie detection ability: "effect: you are able to know whether someone is telling a lie or not. this effect applies to not just people but also npc and monsters! however, something that the other party believes as the truth might be."
23.4.B.1.jpg;  A robotic arm presents a screen reading: "objectively false. to believe. to suspect. in the end, the final choice is always up to you. *however, there is no guarantee that people will believe your words."
23.4.C.0.jpg;  The older man in the blue suit confidently addresses the room, "as you all can see, i have an ability that lets me discern peoples lies." 
23.4.C.1.jpg;  The sword-wielding man in the black jacket prepares to strike the woman in the white coat. "it is not an exaggeration to say that this skill was what got me to the position of vice-captain of the vigilante corps." 
23.4.D.0.jpg; The armored man stands resolutely in front of the building, identified as "sword saint. kim gong-ja." He calmly states,  "if you two will trust in me, i will guarantee the validity of your statements." 
23.4.D.1.jpg;  The armored figure confidently grips the golden sword hilt, prepared for action. 
23.4.E.0.jpg; The brown-haired man with determined amusement, states, "suspicion is a poison that gnaws away at people. truth is the antidote." 
23.4.E.1.jpg;  The white-haired man listens intently, then suggests "isnt this the perfect opportunity? we cant do anything about the distrust that has built up till now, but we can at least cooperate on floor 12."
23.4.F.jpg;  The man in the dark jacket raises his hand thoughtfully. "to clear suspicions raised by a skill by using another skill. i'm fine with that."
23.5.A.0.jpg;  In an ornate room, the grey-bearded man addresses a young woman with a serious expression. "...miss paladin. you are the only one here to have never harmed another human being." 
23.5.A.1.jpg; The man in the blue suit brandishes his sword with unwavering resolve. "alright. i shall put my faith in you as well." 
23.5.B.jpg;  The armored figure stands resolute, eyes closed in deep concentration. "then i shall proceed, as both are in agreement." 
23.5.C.jpg;  The conversation continues, "then sword saint, please ask kim gong-ja. i will put my honor as well as the honor of the vigilante corps on the line, and fairly validate your answers." 
23.5.D.jpg; The man with short black hair watches nervously as the white-haired man raises his sword, preparing for a serious action. 
23.5.E.0.jpg;  A giant hand clenches tightly around a sword. "hunter kim gong-ja. you have murdered over"
23.5.E.1.jpg; The dark-haired man stands calmly, arms crossed as he questions, "4000 people. is that true?"
23.5.F.jpg;  The man in the black jacket smiles down confidently. "yes." 
23.5.G.0.jpg;  Outrage fills the air as accusations are hurled, "aha! do you all see! you lowly filth. to be using this man as an assassin for who knows what..."
23.5.G.1.jpg;  The white-haired man points accusingly, his face a mask of rage. "it is false."
23.5.H.jpg;  Confusion washes over the white-haired man as he stares in disbelief. "?" hangs in the air above him.
23.5.I.0.jpg;  With a grave expression, the white-haired man points to the young man with black hair.  "that answer was a lie."
23.5.I.1.jpg; Looming over the kneeling knight, the man in the blue suit declares, "in other words, he has not killed 4000 people." 
23.6.A.0.jpg; Standing on the platform, the black-haired man smiles, "do you have any more questions?"
23.6.A.1.jpg;  Bewilderment and confusion are etched on the white-haired man's face as he stares, a single "?" hovering above him.
23.6.B.jpg;  The white-armored knight stands perplexed, "what a weird question to begin with. can one person even kill that many people?"
23.6.C.0.jpg; The white-haired man gestures with concern as the black-haired man, face tight with anger, retorts, "th-that's because you guys have raised this young man as an elite assassin..."
23.6.C.1.jpg;  The white-haired man points angrily at the black-haired man, who confidently proclaims, "that's right! i am an elite assassin!" 
23.6.D.jpg;  The white-haired man's face contorts in fury, "that is a lie." 
23.6.E.0.jpg; The grey-haired man in the blue suit gestures angrily. "paladin! i have completely misjudged you! i believed that if it was you, you would mediate without lying!"
23.6.E.1.jpg;  The man in the blue suit walks away from the armored man, who counters, "isn't that why i asked you at the start? if you would actually trust me?"
23.6.F.jpg;  Disappointment and shock fill the white-haired man's face. "are you... going to go back on your words now?"
23.6.G.0.jpg;  The grey-haired man sputters in disbelief, "wa- wait!!! it is impossible that he hasn't murdered a single person! ah, that's right." 
23.6.G.1.jpg;  The white-haired man throws his hands up in exasperation as the black-haired man calmly states, "it is the truth." 
23.6.H.jpg;  A smug grin spreads across the black-haired man's face as he points, "but it is exactly one person. it is the truth."
23.6.I.0.jpg;  The black-haired man leans forward. "of course, murder is still murder. however, that bastard really deserved it." 
23.6.I.1.jpg;  The black-haired man smiles confidently. "it is the truth." 
23.7.A.0.jpg;  The black-haired man explodes in righteous fury, "not only did he try to kill me first! he was actually, in fact, an unbelievable mass murderer!!"
23.7.A.1.jpg;  The black-haired man pauses, his anger simmering. "hmm." 
23.7.B.0.jpg;  The grey-haired man stares in horror, eyes wide with terror. "they are all the truth." 
23.7.B.1.jpg;  With newfound determination etched on his face, the grey-haired man strides forward, leaving the man in the black robe and the armored man behind.
23.7.C.0.jpg;  The blonde-haired woman laughs lightly, "what an interesting theory! it would have been great if it was true. unfortunately, yesterday was the first time we met hunter kim gong-ja!" 
23.7.C.1.jpg;  The blonde-haired woman throws her head back in genuine amusement, her laughter echoing around the startled man in the suit.
23.7.D.0.jpg;  The red-haired man hangs his head in disappointment. "sigh... gramps... i told you before... that you'd be doomed by relying on stuff like skills..." 
23.7.D.1.jpg; The black-haired man flashes a satisfied smirk, pleased with himself.
23.7.E.0.jpg;  The grey-haired man glares at the black-haired man, who only smiles wider in response. "it seems like there was a great misunderstanding on both sides."
23.7.E.1.jpg;  The grey-haired man pinches the bridge of his nose, struggling to contain his frustration, while the black-haired man remains coolly impassive. 
23.7.F.0.jpg;  The man in red shoes exhales, visibly relieved. "i'm glad that it was merely a misunderstanding."
23.7.F.1.jpg; The man in red shoes turns slightly, a mischievous glint in his eye. "but..." 
23.7.G.0.jpg; The battlefield is full of particles as the young man angrily argues, "Had the guild masters not protected me, I probably would have died, right?"
23.7.G.1.jpg; The old man, his face a mask of rage, stands nearly nose to nose with the younger man.
23.8.A.0.jpg; Standing in a dimly lit room with deep red walls, the brown-haired man firmly states, "I think at this point, I need to receive an apology from you." 
23.8.A.1.jpg; He smirks as he looks down, a dangerous aura surrounding him.
23.8.B.0.jpg; A palpable tension fills the air as the grey-haired man with piercing blue eyes asks, "What do you think, Mr. Sword Saint?"
23.8.B.1.jpg; The older man in the dark suit stares ahead, his face unreadable.
24.1.A.0.jpg; In a room with an elaborate floor pattern, the two men stand locked in a heated conversation. "I think at this point, I need to receive a word of apology from you." the older man declares, while the younger man looks down, pondering the older man's next words, "What do you think, Mr. Sword Saint?"
24.1.A.1.jpg; The tension between them is thick enough to cut with a knife as their serious expressions betray their inner turmoil.
24.1.B.0.jpg;  Inside the detailed building, the truth is laid bare: "It is the complete truth. You are fully in the wrong."
24.1.B.1.jpg;  With his back turned, the old man with the sword commands, "Apologize to Kim Gong-ja already, Sword Saint." as the younger man and a woman in blue armor stand to his right.
24.1.C.jpg; The old man in the blue jacket stammers, his face panicked, "I-i am..."
24.1.D.jpg; The young man with dark hair stands in a room of mirrors, a woman in a yellow dress beside him, contemplating, "I, to that hunter..."  "How will he act?" a thought bubble wonders.
24.1.E.0.jpg; A sense of mystery hangs in the air as a question is posed:  "Though famed for being clean, the paladin is still a member of the 5 great guilds. Will he claim that the paladin lied?"
24.1.E.1.jpg;  Red with fury, the old man points accusingly, shouting, "So you are all conspiring together to fool me!" 
24.1.F.jpg;  "Or will he reveal his skill card to exonerate himself? Though it won't fit his image, it will be the perfect evidence." the text ponders against a yellow background.
24.1.G.jpg;  Standing calmly in a grand building, the old man with the sword asks, "...did you say your name was Kim Gong-ja?". "Yes, sir." the younger man replies respectfully.
24.2.A.jpg; Gripping the sword tightly, the old man stares intensely into its reflection. "He might try to silence me by killing me, just like the Sword Emperor. If you have truly never massacred innocent people..."
24.2.B.0.jpg;  Two figures stand silhouetted against a red background.  "Oftentimes, when people are in the wrong, they make excuses or distrust others. Just like how the Flame Emperor revealed his evil nature by choosing to [silence] me." one figure says, their voice full of sadness and betrayal.
24.2.B.1.jpg;  Against a backdrop of red and black, doubt creeps in. "No. This isn't right. With how the Sword Saint resolves this, he will decide on his own what kind of a person he is."
24.2.C.jpg;  Clutching his sword, the man looks down determinedly and pleads, "Please let me try this again."
24.2.D.0.jpg; He sits on the bench, utterly dejected, his head in his hands. "I sincerely apologize."
24.2.D.1.jpg; With a determined look, he grips the gun tightly, his finger resting alongside the barrel. 
24.2.E.0.jpg;  Lost in thought, the man with long white hair sighs, "I was in the wrong. I thought lightly, and lightly made an assumption."
24.2.E.1.jpg;  His face contorted in a mixture of anger and regret, he roars, "...which almost made me lightly kill someone." 
24.2.F.0.jpg;  Standing tall before a wall of glowing red numbers, the man in the blue suit reflects, "Up until now, from my own judgment, I believed that anyone who deserved to die should be purged from this world, even if just a second sooner."
24.2.F.1.jpg;  He confidently grips his sword, his resolve unwavering.  "I killed according to my beliefs."
24.2.G.0.jpg;  The hand in the blue jacket grips the sword tightly.  "The old Swordsman... instead of doubting the paladin or making excuses with his skills..."
24.2.G.1.jpg;  "...words alone are useless. If there is anything you desire, I shall do it." he declares, his grip unwavering.
24.3.A.jpg;  The man with white hair looks down thoughtfully.  "Or even killing me to silence me, he instead accepted his faults... ...at least, that would be the gentlemanly thing to say."
24.3.B.0.jpg;  Standing before a grand door, weary and defeated, the white-haired man pleads, "However, please spare me from taking my own life. I beseech thee... please forgive this shameless old geezer so that he may live on to reach the top of this tower..."
24.3.B.1.jpg;  He looks up, his face etched with worry, begging for his life.  "He pleaded without hesitation to the greenhorn hunter."
24.3.C.jpg; The man in the black jacket reflects on his past actions with a heavy heart.  "'I am sorry.' 'I might be in the wrong.' 'From now on, I will never kill anyone simply because of my skill,'" he vows.
24.3.D.jpg;  He turns to the man in white armor, his face a mixture of worry and hope.  "'And I want to live, so please forgive me.'"
24.3.E.jpg;  The armored warrior stares down in contemplation.  "'They are all truth.'"
24.3.F.jpg;  The older man bows deeply, his staff held respectfully.  "Sir Sword Saint." he murmurs.
24.3.G.jpg;  Desperation fills his eyes as he looks upward. "Please teach me the sword." he begs.
24.3.H.0.jpg;  "Well, to be more precise, from now on, please accept my request for a duel whenever I ask." the younger man requests, his face full of confidence. 
24.3.H.1.jpg;  He sighs, a flicker of frustration crossing his face.  "I somehow ended up having a teacher, but I don't actually have anyone to duel with."
24.3.I.0.jpg;  "Keeping my promise to the guardian spirit, it will be great to partner up with the Sword Saint here. And it'll result in my gain and growth..." he muses.
24.3.I.1.jpg;  A mischievous glint enters his eye.  "If the Sword Saint could be my duel partner..."
24.4.A.jpg;  He clutches at his collar, his face a mask of shame.  "...I'm sorry. Please let me try this again."
24.4.B.0.jpg;  He stands tall, his expression a mix of humility and embarrassment.  "To be honest, I could forgive you without any payment. However, I would feel embarrassed."
24.4.B.1.jpg; His eyes widen in shock, his mouth slightly agape.
24.4.C.0.jpg; He stares at the floor, his shame evident.  "From appearing to be the bigger man. And I'm not someone that great..."
24.4.C.1.jpg;  Lost in thought, he rests his chin on his hand.  "I would feel content with just someone as great as the Sword Saint not viewing me as his enemy."
24.4.D.jpg;  The woman in the fur-trimmed coat squirms under his gaze, her face flushed with shame.  "Swords were crossed, so I feel a bit ashamed to forgive you, pretending to be the bigger man." he admits, avoiding her gaze.
24.4.E.0.jpg; He can't meet her eyes, his face burning with embarrassment.  "...that's why I want you, the Sword Saint, to teach me your best sword technique. Fucking hell!!! I feel so embarrassed!!!"
24.4.E.1.jpg; He buries his face in his hands, mortified. "How was the Sword Saint able to let out all his feelings like that?!" 
24.4.F.jpg;  He stares in disbelief, his mouth hanging open.  "Unbelievable."
24.4.G.0.jpg;  He stares down at the red carpet, stunned.  "Amazingly... that was all the truth." 
24.4.G.1.jpg;  The group stands anxiously, their eyes drawn to something off to the left. 
24.4.H.jpg; The grey haired man with an eyepatch, dressed in black with a red ribbon, glares with frustration, his arms crossed, standing amidst large stone pillars. "... are you being serious?" he fumes, his anger and disappointment evident. "You're okay not asking for anything, but you won't? Because you're too embarrassed to act all high and mighty?"
24.5.A.0.jpg;  Inside, the woman with short purple hair stares at the ground, her disappointment and frustration reflected in the three black mirrors on the wall. "How should I say this... after watching children immaturely preoccupied with self-profit..." she begins.  "...it is surprising to see someone like Hunter Kim Gong-ja after so long." 
24.5.A.1.jpg; The woman with short purple hair, adorned in a white robe with purple fur trim over a black dress, smirks confidently, her right hand on her hip and her left hand extended, fingers outstretched. 
24.5.B.jpg; A blonde woman in a black jacket and white shirt beams brightly, her hands clasped in front of her, her excitement and joy palpable. "Wooow." she exclaims. "How beautiful of a sight is this!"
24.5.C.0.jpg;  Standing outdoors, the blonde woman covers her eyes with her hand, her amazement and wonder evident as she reflects on the scene before her. "Someone who earnestly apologizes with someone who earnestly forgives! Humans fight without end!" she muses.  "That is why a true apology is a holy miracle...!!!" 
25.5.C.1.jpg;  The blonde woman, wearing a black suit jacket and white shirt, walks briskly with a determined stride, her hands moving as she speaks, her annoyance and frustration clear.  "Stop being so noisy, and shut the fuck up." she snaps. "Yep."
24.5.D.jpg; Inside, the woman with long brown hair, dressed in blue and yellow, extends her right hand towards a gray-haired man in a blue suit, her disappointment and anger palpable. "I hate to say this after such a happy ending." she begins. "but doesn't this mean that my 10k gold was wasted for nothing? For me to have..." 
24.5.E.0.jpg; A grey-haired man in a blue suit throws his head back and laughs heartily, his white beard and mustache shaking with mirth, while a brown-haired man beside him watches with a slight smile, relief and happiness radiating from both of them.  "Misunderstood such a kind young man!" 
24.5.E.1.jpg; Confusion and surprise washes over the grey-haired man in the blue suit as he places a hand on the shoulder of the brown-haired man beside him, both their faces etched with astonishment. "Excuse me?" 
24.5.F.0.jpg; The young man with dark brown hair, dressed in a white t-shirt and black jacket, eagerly shakes the hand of someone unseen, his wide grin revealing his excitement and anticipation. "You wanted a duel partner?" he exclaims. "Of course, it would be a pleasure! I would be elated to do so any time!" 
24.5.F.1.jpg;  The brown-haired man, still clutching a metal sword, stares in startled surprise, his face creased with confusion and uncertainty as he shakes the hand of the unseen person.  "Uhm... sir Sword Saint?" he stammers.
24.5.G.0.jpg; The older man with gray hair and beard booms across the room. as the younger man stares back in shock. "Please call me Grandpa Marcus!" 
24.5.G.1.jpg;  Tension crackles between the two men as they shake hands, their expressions revealing the underlying conflict and disagreement.  The man on the right, visibly shocked and confused, mutters under his breath, "Pardon?"
24.5.H.0.jpg;  "Gong-ja." a voice drips with arrogance and self-importance, "how old are you, young man? You can't be older than 30. In the outside world, I have a very kind granddaughter. If she ever enters the tower, I promise to sell her on your charms..." 
24.5.H.1.jpg; Pain flickers across the face of the red-haired man as he sits on the ground, bandages wrapped around his arm, his white shirt visible beneath his black jacket.  Beside him, a man in a suit watches with a similar expression of fear as another man, dressed in a black t-shirt and jacket, looks down in confusion. "Uh-uhm." the man in black stammers, "I'm really okay..."
24.6.A.jpg; The older man with gray hair and beard leans in close, his face a mask of anger and tension, as he confronts the younger man, who avoids his gaze.  "Are you currently implying that you're not interested in my granddaughter?" he demands. "Uh, yes." the younger man mumbles, his discomfort evident.  "I'm sorry, but I'm just not interested at all in seeing someone..."
24.6.B.0.jpg;  "Nonsense!" roars the muscular man with red hair. his white shirt straining against his chest. "The spring of love cannot be absent from youth! When you are in love, you are able to see what you couldn't before! Such as your own depravity!"
24.6.B.1.jpg;  The red-haired man, dressed in white, floats effortlessly in the air, his legs crossed, a look of unwavering determination on his face. "Do you know how important it is to acknowledge your own depravity?" he asks. "It was the year I'd become 16..."
24.6.C.0.jpg; The older man, his face contorted with rage, towers over the younger man in the black jacket, who cowers beneath his furious glare. "What did I say?" the older man thunders, his anger palpable. "I told you he was a boomer geezer."
24.6.C.1.jpg;  "Do you know what a boomer is?" a voice, laced with judgment, questions. "Someone is a boomer when they won't listen to others. If it were to be put nicely, you could say he has a spine.  He has such a spine that he might ascend to godhood with it."
24.6.D.0.jpg; The older man with gray hair places a reassuring hand on the younger man's shoulder, concern etched on both their faces. "...anyway." the older man says gently, "do not worry, young man!" "I didn't know that." the younger man replies, his brow furrowed with anxiety. "Nor did I want to find out..." 
24.6.D.1.jpg;  The older man, his face full of care and concern, rests his hand on the younger man's shoulder. "From now on, I promise to properly look after you." he declares. "Your clothes are very shabby! Let's start with a suit..."
24.6.E.0.jpg; "Should I just fucking kill myself and start today over?!" a voice screams in despair, the words echoing against the blue screen that reads, "[Welcome, Hunter Kim Gong-ja.] [You ranked 1st while clearing floor 11.]"
24.6.E.1.jpg;  Bathed in the blue light of the room, the black-haired man in the white shirt gasps in shock, his eyes wide with surprise as he stares upward.  
24.6.F.0.jpg;  "[Receiving floor 11 clear reward.]." the blue screen announces. "I know a highly-skilled tailor-" a man in a suit, his hand resting on a table, begins. 
24.6.F.1.jpg;  The man with brown hair, clad in a gray jacket and red shoes, turns away, his face unseen. "Since I ranked 1st, it's rewarding me first!" he declares. "Are you listening, young man?" 
24.6.G.0.jpg; "[Please pick from the following two rewards.]." the blue screen instructs.  "I wonder what the reward will be...!" a voice whispers, filled with wonder and anticipation. 
24.6.G.1.jpg;  The black-haired man, dressed in a black jacket, stands with his back to the viewer, a woman with blonde hair and a man in a black robe beside him, the woman radiating a golden glow. 
24.7.A.0.jpg;  "[Goddess of Protection]." the blue text box proclaims. "Explanation: The goddess protecting the Aegim Empire was deeply moved by your efforts!" the yellow text box below it reveals, excitement and wonder radiating from the words. "The goddess has decided to bestow an important position in the empire to you.  You may become the empire's chancellor, the great general, or even the head knight. Once you select your position you will..."
24.7.A.1.jpg;  "This." a voice booms, filled with excitement and amazement, "I've heard of."
24.7.B.0.jpg;  "Hunters take up positions within the Aegim Empire." the text above the image declares, the words "role-playing" scrawled above.  Below, a man in green with a sword stands frozen, his features obscured by a knight in a metal helmet adorned with a red feather, both facing off in silent conflict and tension.
24.7.B.1.jpg; "...and receive abilities and status of said positions." the text within the black frame continues, emphasizing the importance and power associated with these roles, as the armored back of the man remains in view. 
24.7.C.0.jpg; A golden object with wings, bathed in shining light, takes center stage. "[Displaying the special classes available for floor 12]." the blue text above announces.  "[Aegim Empire's Chancellor] [Aegim Empire's Great General] [Aegim Empire's Minister of Finance] [Aegim Empire's Minister of Foreign Affairs]." the text below lists, highlighting the significance of these positions.
24.7.C.1.jpg; The man in the black jacket stares in disbelief, his brown eyes wide with wonder.  "Before." he breathes. "I could only choose from positions like 'Security Guard A'..."
24.7.D.jpg; Dressed in a dark jacket over a white shirt, the brown-haired man eyes the monstrous creature before him with a mix of apprehension and intrigue.  The monster, a shadowy figure with a glowing red chest and a menacing claw, brandishes a sword, its gaze fixed on the man.  "But what is this 'Demon King's reward'...?" the man wonders aloud.
24.7.E.0.jpg;  The large black and red symbol, adorned with two horns on each side and encased in a black frame, radiates an aura of danger and mystery.  "[Demon King of the Autumn Rain]." the text below proclaims, revealing the identity behind the symbol.  "Explanation: The demon king was deeply moved by your efforts." the text continues, its words laced with intrigue. "The demon king is asking for your cooperation in secrecy. The demon king promises the exact same reward as the goddess, but with one additional gift."  A sinister undertone creeps into the final sentence: "Kill all the top 10 heroes except for yourself!"
24.7.E.1.jpg;  The black symbol with the red gemstone at its center pulses with an ominous energy, its intricate design hinting at the dark power it represents.  "If you achieve such a feat, the demon king's authority will immediately ascend you to floor 99." the text above entices, its words a dangerous temptation. "However, only 1 person out of the top 10 may receive the demon king's reward." it warns, its message heavy with caution. "*If multiple people choose this reward, it will randomly select 1 person. *If no one chooses this reward, the demon king's reward will perish."
24.7.F.jpg; The man, his face obscured by shadow, stands in silent contemplation, his dark jacket emblazoned with a red symbol that hints at the choice he faces.  "Kill all the top 10 heroes except for yourself!" the text above him screams, its message a chilling command.  "If you achieve such a feat, the demon king's authority will immediately ascend you to floor 99. *However, only 1 person out of the top 10 may receive the demon king's reward." the text below reminds him, the words a stark reminder of the high stakes involved.
24.8.A.0.jpg;  The grey-haired man in the red shirt and eyepatch jerks back in surprise, his face a mixture of confusion and intrigue. "...What?" he mutters. "Why is he suddenly staring into thin air?" a voice whispers from the left, echoing the man's own thoughts. "If I kill... everyone here." the man thinks to himself, his words trailing off as he grapples with the implications.
24.8.A.1.jpg; Fear and anxiety wash over the black-haired man as his eyes widen in alarm. "I can make my way to floor 99 in one go?" he thinks. 
24.8.B.jpg; "Hunter Kim Gong-ja." the blue rectangle proclaims, its glowing outline illuminating the name at its center, mystery and anticipation hanging in the air.
24.8.C.0.jpg;  The gold and black frames, each containing their own cryptic message in Korean, stand side-by-side, their contrasting colors adding to the sense of mystery and anticipation that surrounds them.

"[Please pick from the following two rewards]." it beckons, its message both alluring and ominous.
25.1.A.0.jpg; "It's a trap." a voice warns, cutting through the silence as the black and gold frame, each containing its own cryptic message in Korean, comes into focus, the air thick with surprise and suspense.
25.1.A.1.jpg;  Clutching a silver and red weapon in his right hand, the black-haired man glances upward, his face etched with surprise, as a larger man with red hair and a bare chest stands behind him, arms crossed, in the opulent room.
25.1.B.jpg;  "It's definitely a trap." a voice whispers urgently. "Don't fall for it, zombie."  The black-haired man in the black jacket, still clutching his weapon, stares down at the marble floor, suspicion clouding his features as he navigates the hallway. "I know that." he mutters. "Of course, it's a trap. Because..."
25.1.C.jpg;  The brown-haired man, lost in thought, stares down at the floor of the darkened room, his brow furrowed in contemplation. "There is no way the Flame Retard wouldn't have chosen the Demon King's reward." he muses to himself.
25.2.A.0.jpg;  "Chapter 25." the title card announces, signaling the start of a new chapter.  Inside the opulent room, confusion reigns supreme as three black-haired men and one with gray hair stare upward in bewilderment. "The Flame Retard would have definitely chosen the Demon King's reward." a voice reminds them, the words echoing their own thoughts.  "However, instead of floor 99, he was only at floor 40." another voice observes, adding to the perplexity of the situation.
25.2.A.1.jpg;  "Therefore, the Demon King's reward is a trap." the man with black hair and a red-sashed jacket concludes. as he addresses the gray-haired man in the blue suit, who stares down at the floor in thought, the armored man listening intently. 
25.2.B.jpg;  Inside the room with red walls and floor, the black-haired man, dressed in black with a silver sword at his hip, contemplates the golden object before him, a thoughtful expression on his face.  "He probably chose the Demon King's reward first." he begins. "and once he realized it was a trap, returned back to the past."  Beside him, a red-haired man with a concerned expression, his bare chest partially covered by a white cloth, stares intently at another golden object in the distance.  The air crackles with suspense as the men search for answers. 
25.2.C.jpg; The man with black hair bites his finger, a concerned look on his face as he thinks, "but... I'm honestly quite tempted."
25.2.D.0.jpg;  The red-haired man stares downwards, a serious expression on his face, wondering, "what if I just went and died once to the floor 99 boss monster...?"
25.2.D.1.jpg; "Gong-ja." the red-haired man whispers, a look of realization dawning on his face. 
25.2.E.0.jpg; "Please don't do that." the man with black hair pleads, concern etched on his face as the red-haired man beside him stands rigidly. 
25.2.E.1.jpg; The man with black hair, a sword hanging at his hip, watches as the red-haired man beside him stares at the ground.
25.2.F.0.jpg; Bold text warns, "Look at me. I'm the Sword Emperor. I'm someone that got to floor 99 and failed. I'm telling you this now, but this is a trap. An absolutely nasty one at that."
25.2.F.1.jpg; The man with black hair, his sword a stark contrast to the white of his shirt, stands beside the red-haired man, his bare chest and bandaged arms a testament to past battles.
25.3.A.jpg; The man with black hair chews his lip, doubt filling his eyes as the words hang in the air above him, "With your current skills, you can't kill the rest of the top 10. And even if you somehow did, you won't make it through floor 99." He whispers, "Is the floor 99 boss monster that strong?"
25.3.B.0.jpg;  Blue chains encircle the ominous message: "There isn't one. Floor 99 doesn't have something like a boss monster... instead, something much more sinister... sigh." 
25.3.B.1.jpg;  The red-haired man, chained to the wall, cradles his head in his bandaged arms, his face a picture of utter despair. 
25.3.C.jpg; "Anyways, this is a trap. I've warned you!" the man in black says, worry evident in his voice. The red-haired man, eyes wide with shock, whispers, "...what's there for you to act like this? I've never seen you act this way. You're scaring me..."
25.3.D.jpg;  The red-haired man, back turned as if facing a challenge, is encouraged by the words echoing around him: "I don't want to admit it, but you're doing well. Just keep doing what you've been doing. Then, you'll be able to naturally clear floor 99."
25.3.E.jpg;  Clutching an unseen object, the man with black hair navigates the dimly lit hallway, his face etched with worry as a solitary "... " hangs in the air. 
25.3.F.jpg;  A small smile touches the man's lips as he declares, "Alright. Then let's go for a mulligan." A confused voice responds, "A mulligan?"
25.4.A.0.jpg; "Yeah. I want to only pick the safest route. I'll even ignore the reward. I just want to see how things turn out." the black-haired man says seriously. The red-haired man beside him can only look away, confusion and fear swirling within him. 
25.4.A.1.jpg; "Even [the goddess's reward]? Why? You don't have to go that far..." the red-haired man questions. unable to understand the black-haired man's strategy.
25.4.B.0.jpg;  "It's okay. I'm taking one step back so that I can take two steps forward. Everyone! Currently, the floor 11 rewards are displayed for me." the black-haired man announces.
25.4.B.1.jpg;  Raising his hand in triumph, the black-haired man beams as someone calls out, "Is that so? That's great."
25.4.C.0.jpg; The man with black hair speaks steadily, his back to us as he advises, "I've been bored, wondering how long I'd have to wait for the quest. Once you select your reward, we should get our turns according to our ranks. So, take your time choosing."
25.4.C.1.jpg;  "Right. I've already made a decision." the man with black hair states, his hand outstretched as if about to grasp his chosen path, while a woman with dark purple hair observes him closely. 
25.4.D.jpg;  "I won't be selecting a reward." the blonde-haired woman declares, a soft smile gracing her lips as the purple-haired woman beside her listens intently.
25.4.E.0.jpg; "What?" the black-haired man blurts out, his face a mixture of confusion and disbelief.
25.4.E.1.jpg;  The black-haired man walks away, the weight of the announcement pressing upon him: "You have not selected a stage reward."
25.5.A.jpg; Confused murmurs fill the air: "The Goddess of Protection is confused by your decision." A chilling laughter echoes, "The Demon King of the Autumn Rain laughs hysterically."
25.5.B.jpg; "Kim Gong-ja? What have you just done..." a man in blue armor roars, his face a mask of shock and anger, while a voice calmly replies, "Hmm."
25.5.C.jpg;  Stroking his chin thoughtfully, the white-haired man in the blue suit muses, "So is it my turn, as 2nd place? I can see it now too. Ahh. I now understand. You've made the safest decision."
25.5.D.0.jpg;  "But was it really necessary for you to yield your reward? I might be worrying like a geezer, but if you're only ever careful, you'll forever remain in place." a concerned voice cautions.
25.5.D.1.jpg;  "Thank you for your concern, but I won't regret it." the black-haired man replies.
25.5.E.0.jpg;  "If that's true, I'm glad, but that's a tactic that I don't think I can copy. I'll be picking the goddess's reward." the white-haired man declares, his gaze filled with determination.
25.5.E.1.jpg;  With his hand raised, a golden aura surrounding it, the white-haired man announces, "Also, I'll be picking Laegim Empire's head knight."

25.6.A.jpg; The white-haired man observes the orange-haired man beside him, a thoughtful expression on his face, "Hmm? Aha! Hmm. So this is how our roles are assigned."
25.6.B.0.jpg; "So that's how it is. I get it now too! It's like a game of mafia." the blonde-haired man exclaims, a look of sudden understanding illuminating his face.
25.6.B.1.jpg;  "I don't understand a single thing you're all saying." the blonde-haired man confesses, his brow furrowed in confusion. "tl/n: sounds sus." he mutters under his breath. 
25.6.C.0.jpg;  Glowing hands reach out, a reassuring voice emanating from their owner, "Don't worry!"
25.6.C.1.jpg; With a confident grin, the blonde-haired man points his glowing finger, "I'll show you right away!"

25.6.D.1.jpg; A purple-haired woman and a knight peer at something, their faces etched with curiosity. 
25.6.E.jpg; "Floor 99...? Seriously?" the gray-haired man with an eye patch sputters, his face a mask of disbelief and annoyance. 
25.7.A.jpg; "This is......" the purple-haired woman seethes, her anger palpable. "Yep! It's similar to a game of mafia!" she spits out, clearly unhappy with the situation.
25.7.B.jpg; The blonde-haired woman smiles slyly, her words dripping with faux sweetness, "For convenience, why don't we call the people who side with the goddess as [heroes] and the one who sides with the demon king as the [traitor]?"
25.7.C.jpg; "Except there's one major difference." the man in blue and white armor declares. "The [traitor] is at a greater disadvantage than in a game of mafia! We have 9 [heroes], and we even have the vice captain of the vigilante corps! He's right. If you guys can trust me, we'll be able to weed out the traitor."
25.7.D.jpg;  "As you can see, this game completely favors the [heroes]!" a man with a gun declares, ignoring the blonde-haired woman beside him who protests, "Hunter Kim Gong-ja, I think it was rash of you to give up the reward!"
25.7.E.0.jpg;  Disappointment flickers across the blonde-haired woman's face as she addresses the soldiers before her, "I do respect your decision, but with that, I'll pick [empire]'s great general!"
25.7.E.1.jpg;  "We swear our loyalty to the highest flag of the empire!" the soldiers bellow, their voices echoing the blonde-haired woman's triumphant smile. 
25.7.F.0.jpg;  A sly smirk graces the gray-haired man's lips as he declares, "So you're saying that picking a reward is more beneficial? Then I'm choosing [head royal bodyguard]."
25.7.F.1.jpg; "Then I shall choose [minister of foreign affairs]. It seems like the best option for me." the man in blue and white armor states calmly, his demeanor radiating confidence. 
25.8.A.jpg; "I'll take the role of [chancellor]. Please do me a favor." the purple-haired woman pleads. "No matter what, don't select the demon king! Don't forget! If no one picks that reward, it'll perish on its own!"
25.8.B.jpg;  With a graceful swirl of her golden fan, the woman with long brown hair smiles confidently, "Don't worry. Of course, I'll be the minister of finance."

25.9.C.1.jpg; Tension fills the air as the grey-haired man with an eyepatch stands beside the blonde woman, a shocked man behind them, as they are revealed to have received the demon king's reward. "[people who have received the demon king's reward, 1.]"

25.10.B.1.jpg;  A conversation unfolds against the red backdrop, recalling a time of great loss and bloodshed. "you mean when the 5 great guilds were the 10 great guilds." "truly many died then. and we killed many."

26.1.C.jpg; In a tense standoff, the paladin, sword half-drawn, directs his questioning at the black-haired man. "hunter kim gong-ja. since you gave up on the reward, you are clear of suspicion. however, i shall still ask. did you select the demon king's reward?"

26.1.F.1.jpg; The grey-haired man explodes in a furious denial, stepping towards the composed man with the fan. "fuck, i'm telling you, it ain't me!" "it is not me either."
26.2.A.jpg;  The armored figure and the purple-haired woman stand on the red carpet, the weight of the paladin's words hanging in the air. "they were all truth."
26.2.B.jpg;  The purple-haired woman, her frustration evident, vehemently denies any association with the demon king's reward. "black dragon master. have you selected the demon king's reward?" "no... it wasn't me."

26.3.D.jpg;  As the grey-haired man and the purple-haired woman look on, a figure in silver armor interjects, their voice laced with disappointment. "objection!" "it is entirely within the realms of possibility that i am the traitor."

26.6.D.0.jpg;  The armored man looks up, his expression pained and disappointed. "i clearly asked you to wait...! i pleaded with you to keep your cool, yet as always...!! above the man."
26.6.D.1.jpg;  The ginger-haired man in blue and white armor stammers in disbelief, his eyes wide with shock. "what a strange thing to say, vice captain! i am being cool-headed. below the man." 
26.6.E.0.jpg; The white-haired man gapes in terror as the blonde woman unleashes a flurry of blue and white energy behind him. "i might have been wrong in the end, but luckily, this scene won't be leaked to the media below the woman. with my cool head, i judged that one of those three had the highest likelihood of being the traitor! above the woman."
26.6.E.1.jpg;  The grey-haired man, his face a mask of cold fury, attacks with a surge of purple and white energy, pushing the blonde woman back. "goddammit.....!! below the image"
26.7.A.0.jpg;  The white-haired man unleashes a blinding torrent of blue and white sword energy. "hey, religious nuthead!! give me a heads-up first before killing someone! above the man."
26.7.A.1.jpg;  The grey-haired man deflects the attack with his own burst of purple and blue energy, a low growl escaping his lips. "ah... below the image"
26.7.B.jpg;  The blonde woman sits dejectedly on the stairs, her shoulders slumped as she cradles her injured hand. "i apologize, everyone! i am unable to be of any help right now! above the woman. this is quite serious indeed. i can't complete the rituals for the holy techniques without both hands. above the woman." 
26.7.C.0.jpg;  The grey-haired man in the blue suit stares in disbelief, his glasses slightly askew.  "is that... the problem... right now...?!! below the man."
26.7.C.1.jpg;  The grey-haired man with the eyepatch cries out, his face contorted in pain as he struggles to maintain his grip on his sword. "some. body. help. me! i'm about to die...!!! below the image."
26.7.D.0.jpg;  The black-haired man in the black suit listens with a worried expression as the armored man speaks. "as the only person to pass up on the rewards, you are the only one who is 100% not the traitor. below the men. hunter kim gong-ja!!! i shall trust in your judgement!!! above the men."
26.7.D.1.jpg;  The grey-haired man launches a determined attack, his sword flashing as the purple-haired woman casts a spell above him and the brown-haired woman watches in alarm. "so please, i ask of you! please stop the sword saint! below the man."
26.8.A.jpg; The person in the black and green jacket pours the yellow liquid, their face illuminated by the eerie glow. "it will be better to consolidate power and assign it to someone who is definitely not the traitor. that's a good idea! being democratic isn't the best option right now. above the person's head." 
26.8.B.0.jpg;  The brown-haired man narrows his eyes, his jaw set in determination.  "i shall also pass my authority on to hunter kim gong-ja! until we catch the traitor, i shall not trust in my own judgement! above the man's head."

26.8.C.0.jpg;  Standing tall in the large room, sword in hand, the man in the black robe sighs.  "i even received full authority over the situation from the vice captain and the temple master... above the man's head. am i fated to be a psychopath magnet...? above the man's head."
26.8.C.1.jpg;  The black-haired man keeps his back to the camera, listening intently. "you're climbing up the ranks, congrats. didn't you give up on the reward knowing this would happen? above the man's head. i was actually impressed by your decision. below the man's head."
26.8.D.0.jpg;  The black-haired man walks through the shadowed hallway, a worried frown etching his features.  "there was so much tension between the rankers, i assumed a fight would break out if there happened to be a traitor. above the man's head. that's why i gave it up... but i didn't imagine it'd be this bad... above the man's head."
26.8.D.1.jpg;  Pausing in the hallway, the black-haired man sighs, guilt etched on his face. "i feel so bad for the three innocent guys. i guess i'll have to return once... above the man's head. you have not selected a stage reward. below the man's head"
26.8.E.0.jpg; The man in the black jacket listens intently, his brow furrowed, as the armored man covers his mouth with his hand, a troubled expression on his face. In another room, the blonde woman smiles slyly. "that's right. above the man with the black jacket. uhm, there's something i want to know. above the man with the black jacket. he's always been such a person. below the woman."
26.8.E.1.jpg; The air crackles with tension as the story takes a dark turn: "when we first entered the tower, religion was a big problem. the various religions and sects kept fighting over and over. that's when the heretic inquisitor appeared and..." 
26.9.A.jpg; The cloaked figure walks purposefully towards the bottom of the image, their form shadowed against the splattered red background.
26.9.B.0.jpg;  The dark-haired man recoils in shock, his eyes wide with disbelief.  "killed them all. above the man's head. he's only ever known such methods... above the man's head."
26.9.B.1.jpg; The dark-haired man grapples with the unsettling truth, his expression clouded with doubt. "i thought the religious groups had all peacefully come to an agreement... left of the man. but was that just the media covering up for them? right of the man. a new horizon of peace for religio above the man."
26.9.C.0.jpg; The blonde woman flashes a relieved smile, brushing off her close call. "that was close! above the woman's head. shit, fuck! this one might actually get me! above the woman's head. i am aware that my rash judgement has caused quite the turbulence. left of the woman. i am quite ashamed, hunter kim gong-ja! right of the woman."
26.9.C.1.jpg; The dark-haired man covers his mouth with his hand, his eyes filled with distress. "this might be the end for the celestial martial clan, you fucks!! above the man's head. on the premise of receiving full authority from me, could you please stop the sword saint? left of the man. you seriously... no. bottom left of the man. we can talk about you in depth later. bottom right of the man"
26.9.D.0.jpg;  The grey-haired man charges forward, his glowing sword held high, a look of fierce determination on his face. "sword saint-nim!!!!! above the man's head."
26.9.D.1.jpg;  The brown-haired woman stands tall, her eyes blazing with resolve.  "please listen to me, the one you bowed your head to earlier today!!! left of the woman."
26.9.E.jpg;  The man in the suit leaps towards the man in the black coat, their swords clashing in a flurry of blue and purple sparks, as the brown-haired woman watches anxiously. "let's stop fighting and talk this out!!! above the man in the suit."
26.10.A.jpg;  The grey-haired man stares resolutely ahead, his mind made up.  "i shall ask your granddaughter out! below the man."
26.10.B.jpg;  The white-haired man levels a cool gaze at the man in the black coat, his glowing sword held at the ready.  "if she ever enters the tower, sure, i'll meet her. above the man's head. could you please listen to the request of the one that might become your grandson-in-law?! below the man's head."
26.10.C.0.jpg;  The grey-haired man fixes his gaze on his opponent, his expression unwavering.  "i have not forgiven them yet. above the man's head. i'm definitely not pausing the fight just to hear you out. below the man. it's just that after crossing swords, i'm certain i can kill them anytime. right of the man's head."
26.10.C.1.jpg;  The white-haired man explodes in a furious rant, his face red with anger. "so it won't be too late to kill them after we've uncovered the traitor! above the man. why are you telling me all this? below the man. you're on the right track! you can always kill them later." 
26.10.D.jpg;  The man with grey hair clutches his chin, eyes wide with shock behind his sunglasses. "...is it over?" he asks, staring at the white-haired man in the blue suit holding a spear. 
26.10.E.0.jpg;  "Please, let's all be calm now." a voice booms, "we don't know who the traitor here might be."  The assembled group stands in tense silence as the voice continues, "We might even never find out the traitor. However, that's not the main thing."
26.10.E.1.jpg;  The man with brown hair turns away from the others, a surprised and worried frown on his face. Behind him, the white-haired man in the blue suit offers a salute.
26.11.A.0.jpg; "How is that possible?" someone asks, bewildered. "We can resolve this crisis even without finding the traitor." another voice assures. 
26.11.A.1.jpg; The man in blue and white armor frowns, anxiety etched on his face. "King's reward means that they'll be aiming for our lives." he thinks grimly. 
26.11.B.0.jpg;  "Take a look at this." the man with brown hair says, gesturing with his sword towards the large white screen displaying "goddess's reward" and "demon king's reward". 
26.11.B.1.jpg;  A hand points upwards towards a message: "You may become the empire's chancellor, the great general, or even the head knight. Once you select your position, you will also receive abilities and status deserving of the position. Oh hero of the goddess! Gather up forces with your fellow heroes, and destroy the demon king's core on floor 20!" "It says the demon king's core exists on floor 20." someone exclaims excitedly. 
26.11.C.0.jpg;  "Don't focus on finding the traitor. That's a trap." a voice whispers. "The traitor might already be cowering in fear." another suggests. "It might even be that the system forcibly assigned the traitor." a third voice adds. 
26.11.C.1.jpg;  "So, let's all kick the demon king's ass together." the brown-haired man declares, confidence radiating from him as the grey-haired man in the red jacket nods in agreement. 
26.11.D.0.jpg;  The man in the brown jacket shoves his hand into his pocket, a contemplative frown on his face. *If we get rid of the demon king, the reward will also disappear. It's a simple problem,* he thinks as a message appears above his head: "[The goddess of protection smiles radiantly.]" 
26.11.D.1.jpg; The man in black ascends the staircase, his stride confident and assured.  *[The demon king of autumn rain is annoyed.]* "Though the tower may always try to test us, the solution will always be simple."
26.12.A.0.jpg; The dark-haired man stands before a blue and white screen that reads "[You are given the floor 12 quest.]" "Let's climb the tower." he decides, a determined look in his eyes.
26.12.A.1.jpg; With unwavering resolve, the dark-haired man strides forward, ready to face whatever challenges await him. 
27.1.A.jpg;  "[You are given the floor 12 quest]." the screen announces as the dark-haired man grips his two swords, a determined glint in his eye. Behind him, the older, white-haired man watches with quiet concern.
27.1.B.jpg; The group of four, faces etched with concern and apprehension, stare nervously at something unseen.
27.1.C.0.jpg; A dark shape slices through the dimly lit room, its movements fast and aggressive.

27.1.D.0.jpg;  The man with the glowing red eye trembles, surrounded by a flurry of red streaks. "It's the nightmare... the rain of the nightmare is falling again... we're doomed." he whispers, fear clinging to his words.
27.1.D.1.jpg;  "It's the demon king..." the grey-haired man gasps, fear twisting his features. "Wh-what the fuck? What's up with them all of a sudden...? Oh goddess... where is our lord...?"
27.2.A.0.jpg; "This is all just part of the act, right? What's up with all the NPCs?" a voice wonders aloud, suspicion tinging their tone. 
27.2.A.1.jpg;  The man in the black suit stands before the archway, back to the viewer. "The quest has finally started."
27.2.B.0.jpg; The black-haired man strides confidently down the red carpet, his two swords held loosely in his hand, as two fallen figures lie ignored on the ground behind him. 
27.2.B.1.jpg; The black-haired man swings his green sword, a blur of motion against the vibrant backdrop. 
27.2.C.0.jpg;  "[The demon king of autumn rain has manifested]." a message declares as a dark window frames a stormy red sky.
27.2.C.1.jpg;  "That's 'weakened'?" the black-haired man murmurs, gripping his sword and pistol as he stares out the window at the shadowy figure looming behind a blood-streaked wall.
27.2.D.jpg;  "Oh, you poor souls." the monstrous mouth sneers, sending chills down the spines of those who hear it.
27.3.A.0.jpg;  The grey-haired man in the suit glares at the viewer, his expression a mask of fury.  "Did you think you foolish plebeians could call over people from another world to use as your shields?" he snarls.
27.3.A.1.jpg;  The man in the suit plunges his sword into the armored man, a cruel smile twisting his lips as his victim cries out in pain. 
27.3.B.0.jpg;  "Call as many as you want." a message echoes through the dark hallway where the brown-haired man stands. "Bring forth thousands of heroes and even more knights."
27.3.B.1.jpg;  The man smiles, a purple glow emanating from the object in his left hand. "However, they are still human beings, just like you." he muses. "I pity your foolishness that knows no bounds."
27.3.C.0.jpg; "Those that don't see humans as humans." the screen declares, its message hovering over a blurred map marked with ominous red dots. 
27.3.C.1.jpg;  A hand lifts the futuristic tablet, the map on its screen now adorned with two words: "ding! ding!" 
27.3.D.0.jpg;  The map, awash in a dizzying blue, white, and pink aura, pulses with chaotic energy.
27.3.D.1.jpg;  "May you be swallowed whole by your own evil." a voice booms as the blue aura envelops the map once more. 
27.4.A.1.jpg;  "...the demon king can summon a monster army any moment. The demon king is aiming for the heart of the Aegim empire, the emperor's city--Hacamonia. Thankfully, the demon king's power has weakened after the long journey. Stop the demon king! 'If you fail this battle, floor 13 will not open.'" Three figures stand in the desolate landscape, heads bowed as if in prayer.
27.4.B.jpg; "The demon king... is weakened?" the grey-haired man with the eyepatch exclaims, his surprise evident.
27.4.C.0.jpg;  "That's 'weakened'?" a hooded figure, sword glinting in the crimson light, scoffs as four monstrous figures snarl behind him.
27.4.C.1.jpg;  "How... is this fair?!" the grey-haired man with the sunglasses shouts, gesturing at the carnage around them. "Is this quest even possible to clear?"
27.5.A.0.jpg; "I get that it was a tutorial until floor 10, but isn't this too much of a jump in difficulty...!" someone protests. "Let's stop there. Let's all calm down. We can do this. The tower doesn't give quests that aren't clearable."
27.5.A.1.jpg;  The man in the brown jacket charges forward, his expression grim as he brandishes a long, green object. 
27.5.B.0.jpg; "We aren't just your average hunters here. Did you forget? You are the head royal bodyguard. So, lead the royal bodyguards." a voice commands, disappointment lacing every word. 
27.5.B.1.jpg; The grey-haired man with the eyepatch glares down at the three armored figures lying prone at his feet, his expression a mixture of anger and sorrow. 
27.5.C.0.jpg;  "This stage can't be cleared with just the power of us hunters alone." a voice urges. "Rally the NPCs and lead them. Treat them like they are real people, and lead them into battle."
27.5.C.1.jpg;  The woman in blue and yellow observes the three kneeling figures with an air of detached boredom, her fan waving lazily in her hand. 
27.5.D.0.jpg; "We shouldn't fight amongst ourselves, Sword Saint-nim. You are the Head Knight. How can we defend the nation from enemies if the Head Knight and Head Royal Bodyguard are crossing swords with each other?"
27.5.D.1.jpg;  "We have received the [role] of commanders, so we must fulfill that role." the white-haired man declares, his gaze steady as he addresses the two armored figures before him. 
27.5.E.jpg;  "Minister of Foreign Affairs, we are in the emperor's chamber, but the emperor is nowhere to be seen." the armored man reports, concern etched on his face. "With the Foreign Affairs Department NPCs, please find the emperor. It won't be easy to lead the NPCs while their leader is missing."  "Roger that." comes the reply.
27.6.A.jpg;  "Great General." the blonde-haired man in the white glove announces. "Yep! That's me." the man in the dark suit confirms, a confident smirk playing on his lips.
27.6.B.0.jpg;  "I especially hate hunters like you." the dark-haired man says, his gaze cold and hard. "We'll need to resolve this conflict one day. However, right now is not the time for that. We need the general." 
24.5.C.1.jpg; The blonde woman in a black suit jacket and white shirt walks towards the left, her annoyance evident in her text, "stop being so noisy, and shut the fuck up." and "yep."
27.6.B.1.jpg; In a light blue room, the blonde woman with blue eyes playfully teases the dark-haired man with dark eyes, "hahaha, but i'm starting to like you even more now, hunter kim gong-ja!" and "since you said you'd give me all the authority, just shut up and listen to me."
27.6.C.jpg; The four soldiers clad in armor stand guard on the castle walls, the fear evident on their faces as they discuss the potential breach, "the soldiers in front of the castle walls are probably losing their minds right now." and "you need to get on top of the castle walls and console them yourself." and "mmm! you want me to be noblesse oblige!"
27.6.D.0.jpg; In a pink room, the dark-haired man with dark eyes looks worried and serious as he delivers orders, "no matter what, defend the castle walls." and "if our defenses are breached, this stage will be over."
27.6.D.1.jpg; The blonde woman with blue eyes stands determined in a light blue room, her expression resolute as she promises, "i have never broken a promise since the day i was born." and "i promise to defend it with my life!"
27.6.E.jpg; The dark-haired man with dark eyes appears commanding in a gray and red room as he issues orders, "this is the order of the head knight!" and "department of finance, assemble!"
27.7.A.0.jpg; Under a dark red sky, acid rain pours as someone remarks, "then, i'll head out first." and another questions, "what is this rain?! is this acid rain?"
27.7.A.1.jpg; The blonde woman in a white jacket and black gloves stands next to a startled man in a brown shirt and brown pants, exclaiming, "wow. this place looks nice!" and "it's way better than that dinky-ass port!"
27.7.B.jpg; Kim Gong-ja, a hunter with a determined expression, charges forward in a gray and brown room while holding a sword in one hand and a gun in the other.
27.7.C.0.jpg; A surprised woman with purple hair and purple eyes utters, "witch-nim?" as if she has encountered an unexpected acquaintance.
27.7.C.1.jpg; Despite her serious expression, the woman with long purple hair exudes confidence and power as she declares, "call me the black dragon master. i personally don't like my title."
27.7.D.0.jpg; Confusion washes over the purple-haired woman in a blue dress as she questions the man in black, "how did you suddenly get here?" To which he replies, "that's my skill. tele-portation."
27.7.D.1.jpg; Excitement radiates from the man with long red hair as he reveals his ability, "i can teleport to anywhere that's within my range of vision." A voice from below adds, "tele-portation sounds like a sick skill!"
27.8.A.jpg; Concern clouds the man's face as the woman with long purple hair challenges him, "then what are you doing instead of getting to the castle walls first?" She responds, "it should be obvious. i'm here to bring you with me."
27.8.B.jpg; Mounted on a brown horse, the man in black raises his shining sword, inspiring awe in the crowd. They acknowledge his worth, saying, "i witnessed it on floor 11. you have a sword that the npcs admire, don't you?"
27.8.C.jpg; Surprise and confusion cross the man's face as he questions, "consent?" with a question mark floating above his head.
27.8.D.0.jpg; Frustration evident in his expression, the man demands, "verbally consent that you agree to teleport with me. without it, i can't teleport you. that's the restriction of my skill."
27.8.D.1.jpg; Contemplation deepens on the man's face as he wonders, "wait a sec. teleportation should at least be an s-rank skill... is it really okay to tell me everything, including its restrictions? isn't the skill supposed to be a hidden trump card?"
27.8.E.0.jpg; Confusion clouds the purple-haired woman's face as she questions, "that's odd. didn't you say that i'm this empire's chancellor?"
27.8.E.1.jpg; Power radiates from the purple-haired woman as she extends her right hand, her expression serious and unwavering.
27.9.A.0.jpg; In the face of urgency, the purple-haired woman declares, "we don't have time. just agree already."

27.9.B.0.jpg; Shock and surprise wash over the man as the purple-haired woman asserts, "...i consent to the black dragon master's skill usage." She adds, "there's one more restriction."

27.9.C.1.jpg; Desperation and despair permeate the air as the kneeling armored man pleads, "please take pity on our souls..." Another text acknowledges, "even if they are an illusion, their fears are not."

27.10.B.0.jpg; Anticipation fills the air as the purple-haired woman stands on a cobblestone path, looking up. A text reads, "thank you for bringing me here. starting with this..."

38.1.B.0.jpg;  Another blue rectangle appears, this time displaying "[welcome, king of death.]" 
38.1.B.1.jpg;  A silver-haired man in a blue suit, sword in hand, stands with his companions, a woman with long black hair and a man in a red jacket holding a gun. 
38.1.C.0.jpg; A cloaked figure, surrounded by swirling red energy, shouts,  "i shall not forgive thee!! how dare thee! to mine children! children i hadst given mine salvation! to forcefully taketh them away from me! art thou making a mockery of me?"
38.1.C.1.jpg; The man in the red jacket stands with a pink-haired woman and a white-haired man, facing a shadowy figure as they cry out, "Art thou taking mine flesh, mine blood, mine spirit?!"
38.1.D.0.jpg; The silver-haired man, now with a beard, glares at something off-screen as he yells, "i curse thee!!!!!!!".
38.1.D.1.jpg;  "What an awful scream.  I have never heard such a voice." the man in the blue suit says, concern etched on his face. "Same here.  Why is the demon king screaming like that...?" the woman in the purple robe wonders as she reaches out a hand, dark streaks emanating from it.
38.1.E.jpg;  The young man, eyes glowing red, looks up in surprise, "huh?" as red energy surrounds him. 
38.2.A.0.jpg;  The red-haired man, arms crossed, scowls as he mutters, "What's up with this guy? They're weaker than before."
38.2.A.1.jpg; "What?" the young man in the red jacket exclaims, his eyes widening in shock. "Before."
38.2.B.jpg;  "I'm sure they got hurt after being showered in aura attacks from that witch girl." the red-haired man muses, touching his chin thoughtfully,  "but it isn't like they've been injured."
38.2.C.0.jpg; Several gruesome, green-skinned creatures snarl menacingly in their dark cave.  "And more like their [rank] dropped." a voice echoes around them. "To put it in perspective, on floor 12, this guy was like an SSS-rank goblin king.  But now, they're more like a non-SSS-rank goblin king."
38.2.C.1.jpg;  A large, black structure, streaked with red, looms over the city.  "You know, like the one you beat half-assedly on floor 5 by going goruk goruk." the voice continues. 
38.2.D.0.jpg;  The young man in the red jacket frowns, deep in thought. "That's odd.  Don't bosses normally get stronger as you climb higher up the tower?  Did the witch's aura laser beam maybe have a level-dropping effect?" 
38.2.D.1.jpg; He continues to ponder, staring thoughtfully into the distance.  "Was there maybe...an unexpected change to the stage?" 
38.2.E.jpg; A blue, rectangular box appears, displaying the message, "Tabulating floor 12 rewards..."
38.3.A.0.jpg;  The box suddenly changes, now flashing, "[Unable to tabulate!] G12!  [All the rewards will be tabulated upon clearing floor 19.]"
38.3.A.1.jpg;  "Ok." the man in the red hoodie says faintly, his hand glowing with pink light as a blue box appears before him. "[You will only receive the basic rewards for now.]" 
38.3.B.jpg;  A blue rectangle pops up, announcing, "[The goddess of war's blessing has been buffed!]"
38.3.C.0.jpg;  Another blue rectangle appears, this time displaying,  "[You now have access to all the maps from floor 11 to floor 20!]" Below, a detailed map unfolds, dotted with red and blue markers.  
38.3.C.1.jpg;  "A world map...?!" the man in the red hoodie gasps, pointing at the intricate map in awe.  
38.3.D.jpg; "I get it!" the man in the blue suit declares, striding forward with determination as the purple-haired woman follows closely behind.
38.3.E.jpg;  "I know why the demon king is acting like that!  Black Dragon Witch, please think back to the previous stage." the young man with red eyes snarls, a furious smirk twisting his lips. 
38.3.F.0.jpg;  The snow falls softly on the quiet town, the caption above starkly contrasting with the peaceful scene: "The history of the demon king's invasion of the capital was erased, and the refugee camp completely disappeared."
38.3.F.1.jpg; The young man and the purple-haired woman stand side-by-side on a rooftop, gazing out at the town spread before them. 
38.4.A.jpg;  The map reappears, this time with a new message:  "Think about it!  Where do you think the refugees came from?  They probably came from all over the empire, no, all over the continent." 
38.4.B.jpg;  "I see." the black-haired woman murmurs, her magenta eyes narrowed in thought. 
38.4.C.0.jpg;  A shadowy figure, wreathed in black smoke and red light, appears as a voice booms, "Exactly!  We've returned to a time before [the demon king properly invaded the continent!!] Kkwaaaaaah!!" 
38.4.C.1.jpg; A monstrous, horned creature, shrouded in shadow, lays siege to a grand temple. "And currently, this temple is under attack!" a voice calls out urgently.
38.4.D.jpg; "That thing's level dropped." the red-haired man says, his eyes wide with surprise. "Eh?"
38.4.E.jpg; The man in the red jacket, eyes blazing red, tightens his grip on his weapon.  "You know that voice we hunters hear whenever we level up? [Your existence becomes better defined]." he reminds them.
38.4.F.jpg; The image splits, displaying two separate thoughts: "I got what it meant by our hunter level going up." and "But I never understood the existence part... I honestly thought maybe it was just trying to sound cool."
38.5.A.0.jpg; A monstrous creature with glowing red eyes crouches low to the ground, its form radiating menace. "That boss monster had probably become stronger by killing countless empire citizens and refugees."
38.5.A.1.jpg; The monster rises, a wicked sword gripped tightly in its claws. 
38.5.B.jpg;  A pair of horns, tipped with glowing red eyes, materialize in the darkness. "But that slaughter has become [something that never happened]. [The demon king of the autumn rain is furious]."
38.5.C.0.jpg; The horns reappear, the glow of their eyes dimming slightly.  "Which means that much growth was erased. [The demon king of the autumn rain's existence becomes faint.]"
38.5.C.1.jpg; A cloaked figure strains against an unseen force, a muffled roar escaping their throat.  "Kuaah... So their existence has become faint!" 
38.5.D.jpg; The black figure explodes in a burst of red, a vengeful scream ripping through the air. "Ye vermin!!!!" 
38.5.E.0.jpg;  "Let's go." the shadowy figure roars, a clawed hand crackling with red energy. 
38.5.E.1.jpg; The white-haired man, the purple-haired woman, and their two companions stand ready, watching as the shadowy figure gathers its power.  
38.6.A.0.jpg;  Two figures, one clad in armor, the other in simple robes, clash in a flurry of motion.  "Oh, ghouls!" one snarls. "Oh, demons!" the other retorts. 
38.6.A.1.jpg; More figures emerge from the shadows, armored and fearsome. "Mine children!!!" 
38.6.B.0.jpg; The cloaked figure raises its hand, purple energy swirling around it. "Kill these vermin!!!"  
38.6.B.1.jpg; Two grotesque figures, their faces contorted in terror, flee in desperation.
38.6.C.jpg; "I never liked zombie movies...!" the white-haired man mutters, sword drawn, as the purple-haired woman prepares to unleash a blast of blue energy. 
38.6.D.jpg;  "Hey, sword broski." the young man with the red jacket calls out, his sword flashing, "why don't we make a bet?" as a nearby zombie lunges towards him. 
38.7.A.jpg;  "Hmm." the red-haired man wonders aloud, watching the battle unfold, "how many lives do you think it'll take for me to beat floor 19?"
38.7.B.0.jpg;  "Alright!" the young man with the red jacket shouts, a confident smirk on his face.  "I bet it'll take you 100 lives at most!" 
38.7.B.1.jpg; "Then I'll bet at most 99 lives!" the young man in the red jacket yells, exasperated. "Seriously? You're gonna play it like that?"
38.7.C.jpg;  "Fine! I'll just sit back and watch a zombie bastard kill his own kind." he huffs, turning away from the others. "Since it's a bet, I'm not helping you. Bet?"
38.7.D.jpg;  "Bet." the other man replies with a confident grin. 
38.7.E.0.jpg;  "Sheesh.  We'll have to do something about their numbers... Black Dragon Witch!  Can't you output more power?" the purple-haired woman shouts. "Back to the past."
38.7.E.1.jpg;  "I'm already giving it my all." she retorts, hand raised as she channels her magic. "Besides, I'm the only one with an AOE attack here. K.D., are you unable to use your skill to fight against them?" 
38.8.A.jpg; "It's currently on cooldown... I'll only be able to use it in about 3 coins." the young man replies, his eyes widening in alarm. "3 coins? There's something like that... Um, Sword Saint-nim!"
38.8.B.jpg;  "Could you lift up the lid to that coffin-like thing?" the white-haired swordsman asks, his gaze fixed on something in the distance. "There's something I need to check. What exactly do you need to check?"
38.8.C.jpg;  "I'll explain later, so could you ask questions then?" the young man pleads, throwing his hands up. "I'm a prophet! Okay?" The swordsman simply stares. 
38.8.D.jpg;  "If the other hunters get to it first, our profits would dwindle." the swordsman mutters as he hefts a long, metal bar. 
38.8.E.0.jpg;  "Ok!  Sword Saint-nim!  That coffin is actually a secret tunnel." the young man explains quickly. "There's a hammer that's effective against undead down there. Can you go grab it with the Black Dragon Witch and use it, please?"  
38.8.E.1.jpg;  "I am a man that has decided to only walk the path of the sword..." the swordsman declares, his expression resolute.
38.8.F.jpg; "And that thing has an AOE effect!" the young man shouts, red electricity crackling around his arm as he battles a zombie. "If you imbue some aura and hit the ground once, a large wave will wipe out the zombies! Understand?"  The swordsman pauses, momentarily stunned. "How do you know all that?"
38.9.A.jpg;  "I'm a prophet!! Okay?!" the young man exclaims, throwing his hands up in exasperation. "Goodness gracious..." 
38.9.B.jpg; "That took care of most of the zombies." the swordsman observes, surveying the carnage left in the wake of his hammer blow. 
38.9.C.jpg;  "Now, time for the demon king..."  But before he can finish his sentence, a colossal, one-eyed monster emerges from the shadows. "What is that?!" the young man cries, staring up at the creature in terror. 
38.9.D.0.jpg; "That's clearly a giant. And it's a zombie. So that'd make it a zombie giant." a disembodied voice notes.  "(Could be a giant zombie, just sayin')."
38.9.D.1.jpg;  "It was probably a guardian of the temple, and it became the demon king's subordinate after being killed." the voice continues. "Heretic Inquisitor would have been able to properly analyze it."
38.9.E.jpg;  "Anyways, I shall handle the giant." the swordsman announces, squaring his shoulders. "Yes, please!" the young man squeaks. 
38.9.F.jpg; A lone figure, cloaked and armed, stands in a dark forest clearing, the air thick with the threat of unseen danger.
38.10.A.jpg;  "Anyways, I shall handle the giant." the swordsman repeats, taking a step toward the monstrous creature.  "No, Sword Saint-nim!  Please continue taking care of the zombies with the hammer!" the young man begs. 
38.10.B.jpg;  "Now, young man, that giant is a perfect opponent for me to test out my swordsmanship!" the swordsman declares, a gleam in his eye. "I'm a prophet! A prophet! Okay?!" the young man cries, throwing his hands up in a gesture of exasperated agreement.
38.10.C.0.jpg;  "Black Dragon Witch!" the young man shouts. "Please shoot your beam at that giant's eyeball." The purple-haired woman narrows her eyes, focusing on their massive opponent.
38.10.C.1.jpg;  "I've been wanting to do that anyways!" she grins, her fist crackling with energy. "Perfect! Let's do it!" 
38.10.D.jpg;  The giant roars, a beam of fire erupting from its single eye and engulfing the night sky.
38.10.E.jpg;  "Ghoul summoning!" the young man yells, a swarm of ghouls materializing around him. "My goodness, K.D., does your skill not have a cooldown?" 
38.10.F.jpg;  "Something like that." the purple-haired woman says, her expression grim.  "Now, you two just need to face off against the giant, but there's something you must not do."
38.10.G.jpg;  "Please, do not attack its eye." she pleads. "How come?" the young man asks, his eyes wide with confusion.
38.11.A.jpg;  "Because something bad will happen." she explains, her gaze fixed on the giant.  "But K.D., look at that giant eyeball!  Can't you see it?"
38.11.B.0.jpg; The giant's eye, huge and yellow, seems to pulse with a malevolent light.  "Yes... I can see it." the young man mutters. "I also can tell that it's an eye that's begging to be attacked."
38.11.B.1.jpg;   The purple-haired woman sighs in exasperation. "But then why? K.D., if you could shoot beams like me...and you saw such an eyeball..."  The young man pauses, his face thoughtful. "I see your point... But you can't."  She throws her hands up in the air. "I don't have time to explain right now...so please!"  
38.11.C.jpg; "Ehhh..." the purple-haired woman hesitates, glancing between the two men. "Let's follow this young man's orders for now. He claims he's a prophet." she says with a shrug.  "Even the Sword Saint..." 
38.11.D.0.jpg;  "Fine." she sighs.  "I'll do my best to not hit its eyeball."
38.11.D.1.jpg;  "Thank you!" the young man chirps, relieved.
38.11.E.0.jpg;   "Mine general...!!!" a voice booms as a creature made of black and blue energy lashes out. 
38.11.E.1.jpg;   "[Demon King of the Autumn Rain retreats to floor 14!]" a message flashes across the air as the young man, the purple-haired woman, and the white-haired swordsman regroup. 
38.12.A.0.jpg; "You rascals!" a voice scolds. "How many times do I need to tell you guys to not run in the temple?"  The trio turns to see a man in white robes approaching.
38.12.A.1.jpg;  "In the name of the Goddess of Protection, I present you with a blessing, sister..." the man says warmly, placing a hand on the purple-haired woman's head.  Two children, one with purple hair and the other with pink, cling to his robes.
38.12.B.0.jpg;  "Let's go." the purple-haired woman says, placing a hand on each of her companions' shoulders. "'Transfer'!"
38.12.B.1.jpg;   "If the other hunters get to it first, our profits would dwindle." the swordsman mutters, hefting his sword as he steps into a dark forest. 
38.13.A.0.jpg; The scene shifts underwater, where a green-haired man and a purple-haired woman stand facing an unseen opponent. 
38.13.A.1.jpg;  The green-haired man charges, his lion-headed sword ablaze with red energy. 
38.13.B.0.jpg;  A red dragon, wreathed in flame, soars through the air, another, smaller dragon trailing behind it. "[Demon King of the Autumn Rain retreats to floor 16!]" 
38.13.B.1.jpg; The young man in the red hoodie stands amidst a raging inferno, his expression grim, sword gripped tightly in his hand. 
38.13.C.jpg;  "[Demon King of the Autumn Rain decides to retreat.] [Demon King of the Autumn Rain retreats to floor 17!]"
38.13.D.jpg;  The world seems to pause as a single message appears: "History is rewinding."
38.13.E.0.jpg;  "[Demon King of the Autumn Rain retreats to floor 18!]"
38.13.E.1.jpg;  "[Demon King of the Autumn Rain retreats to floor 19!] [The Demon King of the Autumn Rain's existence becomes faint.]" 
38.13.F.jpg; A single red eye, glowing with malice, glares out from the shadows. 
38.14.A.0.jpg; "Vermin." a voice hisses from beneath a dark hood. "If not for thee!!"
38.14.A.1.jpg;  The young man in the red jacket stares up at the cloaked figure, his expression a mixture of fear and determination. 
38.14.B.0.jpg;  "Hadst thou just followed the proper steps... if not for thee, none of this wouldst have happened! How dare a measly swordsman from another world...!"  The young man with brown hair floats in a grey cloudy sky, his stern expression a reflection of his anger and frustration.
38.14.B.1.jpg;  The young man, now gripping a blue sword, stands ready, flanked by an older man in a blue suit holding a pistol and a woman with dark purple hair wielding her own blue sword. "Finally." the older man says, a sense of determination and anticipation hanging in the air.
38.14.C.jpg; The young man smiles confidently, his sword glowing brightly as he holds it up. "I can properly see your eye."
38.14.D.0.jpg; A single red eye surrounded by black fabric stares forward in shock. "What...?"
38.14.D.1.jpg; The young man looks down, a dark expression settling on his face. "It's as I said. It took me getting all the way here to finally catch a glimpse of what your eye looks like."
38.14.E.0.jpg;  He points his sword, the tip aimed menacingly at the clouds below. "It'd be a travesty if the demon king and the hero didn't lock eyes once. So fight me with all you got."
38.14.E.1.jpg;  A dark, cloaked figure hovers in the grey expanse, arrogance radiating from its form. "Vermin... or just run away again. Aren't you curious how weak you'll become if you run away again?"
38.15.A.jpg; The cloaked figure, its face twisted in displeasure, continues, "If you don't fight me right now with all you have, you won't be able to beat me." Below, the young man responds, "Is that all thou hast to say..."
38.15.B.jpg; Anger and disgust emanate from the words scrawled across the air, "How a scavenging hyena such as thee... What doth vermin like thee knowest..."
38.15.C.jpg; In a shadowy alleyway, the young man, now identified as Ester, snarls, his hand gripping a small, shiny blade. 
38.15.D.0.jpg;  "If you don't-" Ester swings his silver blade, fear and shock gripping him as he faces the dripping, black, single-eyed monster behind him. "I warned you. Fight me with all you have." 
38.15.D.1.jpg;  Black liquid drips and bubbles, a chilling testament to the monster's power. "My 'time' will become longer than your history." 
39.1.A.jpg; The young man floats upwards, enveloped in a hazy light, the words "[you have died.]" hanging heavily in the air, a testament to the battle's tragic end.
39.1.B.jpg; A bright blue box materializes, a stark warning against a black backdrop: "You are penalized by the skill."
39.1.C.jpg; Fear and helplessness grip Ester as another blue box appears, the words within sending chills down his spine: "Re-enacting the trauma of your killer."
39.1.D.jpg;  The words "certain nightmare" loom above another blue box, the warning clear. "The level of penalty is medium."
39.1.E.jpg; A sense of unease permeates the air as the final blue box materializes, the words "hungry ghost realm.*" a chilling portent of what's to come. 
39.1.F.0.jpg; A man with black hair and a woman with red hair stand before a raging inferno, the air thick with the smell of smoke and ash. "The roaring the fragment the monster - demon king. Burn it all down!!!!!!"
39.1.F.1.jpg; A man with brown hair and red eyes watches in fear and concern as flames engulf the surroundings. "Burn the witch's nest! Show no mercy. They're all monsters under the witch's curse! Don't let a single one get away!" A woman with long, black hair walks away from the inferno.
39.1.G.jpg;  Amidst the chaos and destruction, a woman with blonde hair and green eyes stands defiant, her expression a mixture of anger and determination. 
39.1.H.jpg;  Amidst the inferno, the woman with blonde hair stares out, her face a mask of shock and disbelief. "Why?" she whispers. 
39.2.A.jpg; In a peaceful town, bathed in the warm glow of the sun, an older man and woman in blue robes smile warmly, the woman holding a broom. Beside them, a younger woman cradles a baby swaddled in blue fabric, her face radiating joy.  
39.2.B.jpg;  Five figures in dark robes lie sprawled on the ground, their bodies still. "Their fellow men?" a voice whispers, the words heavy with sadness and loss. 
39.2.C.0.jpg;  Three figures stand against a dark backdrop, two cloaked in shadow, their swords glinting menacingly. The central figure, clad in silver armor and a dark blue cloak, speaks, their voice echoing with power and authority, "It is the will of our lord! Upon the orders of our king - the czar of the great east..."
39.2.C.1.jpg;  Flames rage around a terrified man in a purple cloak as a figure in silver armor raises their sword, their face hidden behind their helmet. "As decreed by the pope, punish the heretic claiming to be a saintess..." Above the armored figure, a voice calls out, "As ordered by the ruler of the forest, oh spirits, bless this arrow..."
39.2.D.jpg; A man with green hair, clutching a staff topped with a blue orb, stands beside a man in a blue robe, his back to the viewer. A figure in silver armor sits atop a magnificent red dragon. "This orb presented to us by the emperor of the merpeople fills our staff with magic... To protect our honorable treaty, we dragon knights will..." 
39.3.A.jpg; Three figures in silver armor, their faces obscured by shadows, stand ominously against a blood-red background, their swords pointed threateningly at a lone figure in a purple cloak, their back to the viewer, reaching out desperately.
39.3.B.jpg;  The three armored figures stand with their backs to the viewer, the red light glinting off their armor. "Who art thou?" they ask, their voices echoing in the sudden silence. 
39.3.C.jpg; Flames engulf a wooden building, casting an eerie glow on the chaos below. A young man with reddish-brown hair stares up in horror as a woman with short dark hair, a determined glint in her eye, raises her weapon. "To incinerate humans?" 
39.3.D.jpg;  In the heart of the inferno, a lone figure kneels, his head bowed beneath his hood, his face etched with pain.  "I know it's hot... just endure it for a bit longer..." a voice whispers through the flames. 
39.3.E.jpg;  Flames lick at the young man's back as he holds an older man close.  "Gramps... it'll all be okay."
39.3.F.0.jpg;  Black clouds blanket the sky, a piece of dark cloth fluttering ominously below. "Everything... will..." the wind whispers, carrying a sense of uncertainty and mystery.
39.3.F.1.jpg;  Dark streaks slash across the cloudy sky as a woman with long blonde hair, clad in a long white dress with a dark blue sash, walks resolutely down a dirt road, her face etched with fear and uncertainty.
39.3.G.jpg;  The woman continues down the debris-strewn road, her expression determined, yet a sense of caution hangs in the air.
39.3.H.0.jpg;  Under a bright blue sky, a man with a basket of red apples offers one to the woman, a wide smile on his face. "Saintess! It's the first apple I picked, please try it!" The woman, her dark red hair framing her face, smiles back, gratitude and happiness shining in her eyes. "I never thought I'd be able to run again... it's all thanks to you, saintess."
39.3.H.1.jpg;  But the moment of peace is fleeting. The woman kneels alone amidst the debris, her back to the viewer, her blonde hair whipping in the wind, her posture conveying a deep sadness and despair. 
39.4.A.0.jpg;  She lies on the dirt road, her white dress stained, her eyes reflecting the desolation around her. "Lefandor... Dajena... Solaphe... Chou... Ugensache..." 
39.4.A.1.jpg;  She stands, a lone figure on the debris-strewn road, her face etched with sadness and loneliness. "Mobajajajaizan... Tofo... Enna... Garchof..."
39.4.B.jpg;  Two hands, clenched tight, covered in dirt and grime, reach desperately upward, a dark liquid dripping from their grasp, their trembling a testament to the fear and desperation consuming their owner.
39.4.C.0.jpg;  The woman with blonde hair, her face streaked with dirt, her eyes filled with anguish, shovels dirt into her mouth, her despair palpable. 
39.4.C.1.jpg;  "Ugh..." The woman sits, her head in her hands, her body wracked with sobs, her white dress a stark contrast to the dirt staining her hands.
39.4.D.0.jpg;  She looks up, her face stained with tears and dirt, her eyes red-rimmed and filled with anguish. "Ugh..." 
39.4.D.1.jpg;  She wipes her eyes with dirt-stained hands, a thought bubble appearing beside her: "Poor things..."  "Ugh..."
39.5.A.jpg; Tears stream down her face, her eye glowing ominously, black and red liquid dripping down her cheek. "I pity thee..." 
39.5.B.jpg; Black liquid engulfs her, threatening to consume her entirely, her face etched with sadness and distress.  "Thou... thou art also human."
39.5.C.jpg; The black liquid spreads across the sand, the sky a bloody red. "Born as humans, thou canst knowest of the beauty of life... and as humans, thou canst also weep. So wherefore..."
39.5.D.jpg;  Inside a wooden building, a woman in a long brown dress and a young girl watch in fear as black liquid oozes from the ceiling. "Wherefore doth thou not bear any hesitancy to call thy fellow humans monsters?"  The girl points upward. "W-what in the-?!"
39.5.E.jpg;  A cloaked figure, its face shrouded, a single glowing red eye burning bright, emerges from the shadows. "How canst thou be humans while mine children art condemned as monsters? Be this thy world?"
39.5.F.0.jpg;  The air crackles with tension. "Art thou the only humans in the world?  I see that thou needeth proof to validate thine own existence as a human."
39.5.F.1.jpg;  A hand, surrounded by red droplets, reaches desperately upward against the dark background, a symbol of despair and isolation. 
39.6.A.jpg;  The cloaked figure stands silhouetted against the fiery landscape, its voice echoing with power and authority, "Well then, 'tis now time for thee to prove yourselves."
39.6.B.0.jpg;  Black liquid streams from the figure's eyes as it cries out in sadness and rage, "I shall curse thee. The pouring rain... thine evil is what created me... will stop any more villages from burning."
39.6.B.1.jpg; The man with brown hair stands amidst the carnage, his hands stained with blood. "Be swallowed up in thine own malice."
39.6.C.jpg;  A man with red hair stands in the eerie red light, his face etched with concern. "Hey, Gong-ja, wake up." 
39.6.D.jpg; A man with black hair, his face contorted in anger, stands defiant. "This place isn't your hell."
39.7.A.0.jpg;  Red lightning blasts the man with brown hair, his scream echoing through the air, "Ahhhh!!!!!!"
39.7.A.1.jpg; He throws himself into a fighting stance, red jacket a blur against the grey, determination etched on his face.
39.7.B.jpg;  He swings a blue sword, red lightning crackling around him, his grunt a testament to his effort. "Ugh!"
39.7.C.jpg; A man with red hair, his face a mask of fury, yells out, "Now!"
39.7.D.0.jpg;  The man with brown hair, his red shirt stained, fights on, fear and worry in his eyes.  "Its head is open!" 
39.7.D.1.jpg; He leaps into the air, bringing his leg down with a powerful kick, his yell echoing his determination. "Ahhhh!"

39.9.E.1.jpg; The man with white hair, a sharp glint in his eye, stands beside her. "Today is the end of the five days. Once you've finished on floor 20, come see me. You and I have a lot to talk about."

40.9.A.0.jpg;  Against a backdrop of blue sky, green trees, and white flowers, a man with short black hair in a red hooded jacket extends his hand, a large yellow orb glowing in his palm.  sss-rank skill. alright. he murmurs.

40.9.D.1.jpg;   "aack!" cries out the blonde-haired woman as she stumbles back, narrowly dodging a sword thrown by a shadowy figure, white flower petals swirling around her.  "so shabby." mutters the man in black, a surprised look on his face as he watches.

40.10.B.0.jpg;  Sunlight filters through the trees, painting the forest floor with dappled light and illuminating a carpet of delicate white flowers. watch closely, zombie. this is why i keep insisting on the importance of the basics. because in the end, the only things you can truly rely on are your own hands and feet.

40.11.F.1.jpg;  fucking come on! why?! Anger and frustration color the voice of the man in the red jacket as he looks up at the red-haired man, who hovers calmly in the air above him, legs crossed.
40.11.G.jpg;  well, because i think youre making some assumptions.  A man with black hair, clad in a red jacket and a black jacket, glares upwards, his anger and defiance evident.  and what assumptions am i making?! 
40.11.H.jpg;  The red-haired man rubs his chin thoughtfully, his expression troubled.  lets say that shes no longer a monster. does that necessarily make her a human? to be more precise, a human like you? 
40.11.I.jpg;   Uncertainty flickers across the face of the black-haired man as he looks down at the sword in his hand. she could have simply become a normal npc. are you sure npcs can be targets of ghoul reincarnation?  "uh... probably? i think?"  comes the hesitant reply.
40.11.J.0.jpg;   Distress and worry wash over a dark-haired man, his shoulders slumped with exhaustion as he stands in a grassy field. "you think? get it together, man! the tower is extremely cold-hearted in situations like this. are you going to take responsibility if it anti-climatically tells you sorry! npcs werent a valid target! after you pulled the trigger without thinking?!

40.11.K.0.jpg;  The setting is a grassy field with a forest in the background. "Take a closer look at the skill card, it says 'ones' you've murdered. Do NPCs apply here?" someone asks.  "But NPCs are also people." the other person replies. 
40.11.K.1.jpg; The blonde-haired woman scoffs at the man, responding arrogantly, "That's what *you* think." 
40.11.L.jpg;  Flustered, he stutters, "Uh...."
40.12.A.0.jpg;  The scene shifts to a conversation with the tower. "Excuse me, Tower-nim?" the man asks. "[The tower pays close attention to what you have to say.]." it replies. 
40.12.A.1.jpg;  The man, looking determined, continues, "There's something I want to ask." 
40.12.B.jpg;   He submits his question to the system: "Is the ghoul reincarnation skill able to turn NPCs into agents of death? Or does it only apply to Hunters like me? [Requesting confirmation from Zuraqua.]"
40.12.C.jpg;   The system processes his request, displaying a blue loading circle. 
40.12.D.jpg;  A *ding* announces the result: "[Unable to confirm.]" 
40.12.E.0.jpg;  Confused and worried, the man looks up at the message:  "[This question surpasses the authority of the tower]."
40.12.E.1.jpg;  He walks forward, clutching his glowing sword. "Excuse me?"  he asks, bewildered. 
40.13.A.0.jpg;  The man glares defiantly as the system verifies his authority:  "[Verifying the authority of the questioner.] [Cleared. Currently, the King of Death possesses the authority of a temporary apostle.]"
40.13.A.1.jpg;  Bathed in golden light and surrounded by white butterflies, the man watches as his question is acknowledged: "[The tower acknowledges the King of Death's question as an official subject for discussion.]"
40.13.B.0.jpg; ".....?!!!" The air fills with yellow light and white butterflies as the tower makes a shocking announcement:  "[The tower requests a vote from the six pillars of all lives.]"
40.13.B.1.jpg; Surprised, the man looks down. "Wait, what is that?!" he exclaims.
