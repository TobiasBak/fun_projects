29.4.C.0.jpg; hahaha, the man with dark hair laughs loudly.
29.4.D.0.jpg; so what? the man asks smiling.
29.4.E.0.jpg; the regent is in control. Every move you make is controlled by us! the man says laughing.
29.5.A.0.jpg; A man quickly draws his sword.
29.5.B.0.jpg; why would we specifically kill him today? the person asks with a sinister smile.
29.5.C.0.jpg; what are you planning to do with him? the young man asks.
29.5.D.0.jpg; at this moment, guro is only your father! you don't even have any command over anybody...  the man says mischievously.
30.0.A.0.jpg; A touch of the heavens.
30.0.B.0.jpg; realistically, you've got potential to become a hero, are you contempt with just being a chummy team leader? the man asks.
30.0.C.0.jpg; you had the courage to attack my father, i will have no mercy as i hack you to death! the man yells angrily.
30.0.D.0.jpg; don't worry, the regent only wants to show guro the true state that the capital is in, the woman says slyly.
30.0.E.0.jpg; the true state of the capital? the man asks curiously.
30.0.F.0.jpg; hmph, the person replies with a cruel smile.
30.1.A.0.jpg; just leave and go rest, i assure you that guro will be safe, the person says reassuringly.
30.1.B.0.jpg; although, if you really wanted to hack me to death...  the person says darkly.
30.1.C.0.jpg; i'd really want to see you try! the man says grinning.
30.1.D.0.jpg; The man with light blue hair stares ahead seriously.
30.1.E.0.jpg; The western campus residence stands tall against the night sky.
30.2.A.0.jpg; the western campus looks really fancy! i still remember my old school's campus...  the boy says happily, pushing open a large door.
30.2.B.0.jpg; The man opens the door, and a woman stands beside him.
30.2.C.0.jpg; The woman with white hair adjusts the strap of her pink dress.
30.3.A.0.jpg; what the fuck! why are you in my room?
30.3.B.0.jpg; huh? why haven't you hit me yet?
30.3.C.0.jpg; you've seen more than this already, how does this count for anything?
30.3.E.0.jpg; it must be the guy from earlier that put us in here together. You're such a wingman! i love you!
30.4.A.0.jpg; i don't understand the intention of these humans, but they are taking good care of us. 
30.4.B.0.jpg; whatever we need is already prepared for us. 
30.4.C.0.jpg; uh huh, we're outside the central area, why don't we just make a run for it?
30.4.D.0.jpg; don't be stupid. The academy keeps good track of their students. They'd know if we went missing. 
30.5.A.0.jpg; The magic teacher told us that the west and north campus are both protected by a magical force field.
30.5.B.0.jpg; eh... So what's our plan? my powers are completely depleted. I have to stay here until i get stronger. 
30.5.C.0.jpg; the demon clan chooses their leader based on the strength of their powers. If i don't reclaim any of my strength, there won't be a point of me going back. 
30.5.D.0.jpg; they wouldn't accept a weakling as their leader. 
30.6.A.0.jpg; they sound pretty mean... 
30.6.B.0.jpg; but don't you worry, you have me. 
30.6.C.0.jpg; i'll bring you back to your tribe, defeat the betrayer and make you the leader once again!
30.6.D.0.jpg; oh?
30.6.E.0.jpg; i found my perfect branch of education, it's forgery!
30.7.A.0.jpg; if forgery is properly practiced, it's bound to be powerful!
30.7.B.0.jpg; is that so?
30.7.C.0.jpg; what about you? did you pick swordsmanship or magic studies?
30.7.D.0.jpg; i wanted to build up my strength again, so i chose to learn both at the same time. 
30.7.E.0.jpg; both teachers accepted my decision to do so. 
30.8.A.0.jpg; so, you're basically a magical swordsman!
30.8.B.0.jpg; magical swordsman, how did you come up with that bullshit?
30.8.C.0.jpg; that's right, magical swordsmen are people who utilize magic and sword in combat. Do you guys not have them here?
30.8.D.0.jpg; magical swordsman... That sounds pretty interesting!
30.8.E.0.jpg; hm... 
30.3.D.0.jpg; you've seen more than this already, how does this count for anything?
27.4.A.0.jpg; The reptilian humanoid slowly turned its head towards them.
28.2.E.0.jpg; The hand held up the tag with the number 103.
