41.3.A.0.jpg; "If the other hunters get to it first, our profits would dwindle." the man thought, his eyes wide with shock as he stared at the swirling vortex.
41.3.A.1.jpg; He stood in the dark room, the patterned floor beneath him cold and unyielding. The vortex, a swirling mass of blue and purple energy, pulsed in the upper right corner, a beacon of both opportunity and danger.
41.4.A.0.jpg; "I knew it! There's no way that was the end!" the man exclaimed, his excitement bubbling over as he read the words "the job change quest will begin." appearing in a bright rectangle above the vortex. 
41.4.A.1.jpg; The man's smile was wide, his confidence radiating as he looked toward the right. The dark room with the blue background seemed to pulse with the anticipation of the upcoming challenge.
41.5.A.0.jpg; The words "the longer you last, the more points you can collect that will place you into a higher-tier job." appeared in a black rectangle, a timer counting down the seconds to the start of the quest. 
41.5.A.1.jpg; "Points?!" he exclaimed, surprise twisting his features. "The longer I last?!" The mans eyes were wide as he stared at the text, the possibilities unfolding before him.  A black rectangle with a blue background appeared at the bottom of the image, displaying "[good luck.]" and "[00:00:01]". 
41.6.A.0.jpg; The seconds ticked by, the urgency of the situation growing as the timer on the black rectangle read "00:00:02". A purple lightning bolt flashed across the screen, a symbol of the power and danger that awaited.

41.7.A.1.jpg; Two figures lay defeated on the ground, their armor dented and scratched, the purple lightning casting ominous shadows around them. 
41.8.A.0.jpg; "I can take these guys on even with my current condition!" the man in the metal suit declared. his weapon held firmly in his grip.
41.8.A.1.jpg;  "If they were on the level of Igris, the first enemies would have been impossible to beat!" he thought, his face serious, a line of black hair framing his forehead. "Every second means more points!" he added, his mind racing with possibilities. 
41.9.A.0.jpg;  "So the chance of obtaining a hidden class goes up the longer the timer goes on...?" he mused, his helmet casting shadows over his features.  "Befitting for a job change quest." he agreed, glancing at the timer that read "00 : 00 : 14". 
41.9.A.1.jpg; Smoke curled from his head, a wisp of energy, as he assessed the situation. "My remaining mana is 390." he calculated, "stealth requires 200 mana on use..."
41.10.A.0.jpg;  "I'll still have 190 mana left!" he thought, a plan forming in his mind. "To maintain stealth, 1 mana is consumed every second."
41.10.A.1.jpg; "That means I can buy 3 minutes of time with stealth." he realized, his eyes focused, assessing his surroundings.  "I still have enough HP and MP! I'll try to last as long as possible!" he resolved.
41.11.A.jpg; Three figures in suits of armor stood in a line, their helmets casting shadows over their faces, their bodies radiating strength and power. 
41.12.A.0.jpg;  "Magician is using 'skill: detection'." a voice announced,  as a figure shrouded in a black cloak stood in the darkness, holding a glowing sphere of blue energy in each hand.

41.13.A.0.jpg;  The man, with his white eyes wide with shock and surprise, stood in the darkness, his black hair framing his stunned expression.  
41.13.A.1.jpg;  "It detected me through my stealth?!" the man in the dark grey hoodie gasped, his eyes wide with surprise as he realized he had been exposed.
41.14.A.0.jpg; Two figures in metal armor clashed in a flurry of movement, their red eyes gleaming as they exchanged blows in a whirlwind of action. 
41.14.A.1.jpg; A blue energy blade, glowing brightly, clashed with a steel sword, the two figures locked in a battle of skill and power.
41.15.A.0.jpg; The figure in black armor was surrounded by chaos, the white glow around them a beacon of resilience as they fought off a relentless barrage of attacks.
41.15.A.1.jpg;  The man in the black hoodie landed with a resounding thud, his determined expression unwavering as he launched into a powerful attack.

41.16.A.1.jpg; The man in the black hoodie leaped through the air, his legs bent at the knee, a blur of motion as he unleashed a powerful attack, the blue glow of his energy swirling around him.

41.18.A.jpg;  The figure in black armor unleashed a devastating attack, the blue glow surrounding them as they struck, the force of their power leaving a trail of destruction in their wake. "The target's stats will decrease by 50% for 1 minute." a message announced.
41.19.A.0.jpg; "Blood-lust's mana consumption is 100." the man calculated, his jaw clenched, worry etched on his face.  "I only get one chance! I have to deal with as many as possible during this window!" he resolved, his arms extended, ready to strike.
41.19.A.1.jpg; The man in the black shirt, his body twisted in a powerful stance, kicked backward, his leg aimed at the charging man in armor who wielded a sword. 
41.20.A.0.jpg; A wave of energy surged forward, the large blue and white outline behind the group of people swirling with power, the feeling of chaos and energy palpable in the air.
41.20.A.1.jpg;  The group of armored figures, their weapons gleaming, rushed forward, their eyes fixed on the bright white light that pulsed in the center of their formation. 
41.22.A.0.jpg; "Gaaah!" the man screamed, his face contorted in pain, his dark shirt stained with blood.
41.22.A.1.jpg;  "They come out of the gates faster than I can deal with them!" the man in silver armor exclaimed, his eyes fixed on the viewer, tension radiating from him.  "[HP: 1036/10278]" the screen displayed, a reminder of the danger he was facing.
41.23.A.0.jpg;  "Passive skill Perseverance is activating." the screen announced, a glimmer of hope amidst the chaos. 
41.23.A.1.jpg;  "Damnit... I took this too lightly!" the man lamented. "I used too much mana on stealth! At this rate, I won't be able to use any skills soon!"
41.24.A.0.jpg;  "Should I use the Hearthstone?" the man questioned, his anger flaring, his scar a stark reminder of the battles he had endured. "I'm not sure what I gain from obtaining a job, but..."
41.24.A.1.jpg; The green stone, swirling with white lines, pulsed in the middle of the screen, a symbol of the power it held.  "Current level... the difficulty is too high!" the man realized. "If I use the Hearthstone... It means I give up the quest! The time?!" He glanced at the timer, his heart pounding with uncertainty. 
41.25.A.0.jpg;  "It's only been 5 minutes?!" the man exclaimed, his eyes wide with shock as he stared at the glowing blue clock, its hands marking a mere 00:05:08.
41.25.A.1.jpg;  "There's no way!" the man gasped, his face contorted with disbelief, his grip tightening on the object in his hand.  
41.27.A.0.jpg;  The black and silver hammer, glowing with a silver hue, slashed through the air, its speed and power evident in its arc.  
41.27.A.1.jpg; The man, his face grim, swung the black and silver hammer in a vicious circle, a purple sound effect trailing behind him.  
41.28.A.0.jpg; The man, his body lying still in a pool of ice, appeared unconscious, a green glowing object hovering above his head, the black sound effect a reminder of the force that had knocked him out.

41.31.A.0.jpg;  The man, his face etched with pain, bent over, his exhaustion evident in his hunched posture.
41.31.A.1.jpg; "It can't end like this." the man muttered, his blue eyes reflecting determination, his face a mask of focus.
41.32.A.0.jpg; "Such a precious chance!" the man thought, his fist clenched, veins bulging, his arm extended towards the right, his determination fueled by the darkness surrounding him. "Because I was at rock bottom..."
41.32.A.1.jpg; Two figures in armor stood vigilant, their faces hidden, their eyes looking upward, a sense of anticipation and danger in the air.  "I longed for the highest place." their shared thought resonated.
41.33.A.0.jpg;  The darkness, thick with smoke, seemed to mirror the despair of the words on the screen. "I know the sadness of being weak more than anyone." the words echoed. "How much help can an E-Rank be..."  "Even the guild is the same, we have to send people who have war potential."
41.33.A.1.jpg;  "That guy... Whew." the words on the screen spat venom.  "Doesn't that guy always hide behind teammates to stay alive? To think that someone who can't even kill one monster properly is a hunter, tsk..."
41.34.A.jpg;  "Aah!" the man in the dark hoodie roared, his frustration and anger bubbling over, his eyes wide with fury.
41.35.A.0.jpg;  A clang echoed through the darkness, the sound of metal on metal, the danger and excitement palpable in the air.
41.35.A.1.jpg; The armored man stood at the top of the screen, his sword raised, a group of armored figures standing below him, their faces hidden, their stance guarded. 
41.36.A.0.jpg; The man, his leg extended, powered through the smoky darkness, his determination unwavering, his nickname, "The World's Weakest." a stark contrast to his relentless speed.
41.36.A.1.jpg;  "Nickname is 'The World's Weakest'." the words on the screen declared. "The World's Weakest? Not the strongest?" the question lingered in the air. "Bro, that's what we call S-Rank Hunters. Sung is considered to be the weakest." 
41.37.A.0.jpg;  "I mean, he's weak enough to get hurt in an E-Rank dungeon..." one man chuckled.  "Is he actually the weakest?" the other inquired. "Yeah, he's probably the weakest of us all." the first man confirmed. "He's actually that weak? So that means our dungeon will be weak as well since he came."  "Ah... I see."  "Hey, he might hear us, let's end it for now, fu fu..."  
41.37.A.1.jpg; "If the other hunters get to it first, our profits would dwindle." the man in the green jacket stated.  The other two men, their faces etched with worry, nodded in agreement.  
41.38.A.0.jpg;  "Sung, you've done what you can. How about getting some rest?" the woman with the long brown ponytail smiled.  The man, his face set in a determined frown, remained silent, his intensity unwavering.
41.38.A.1.jpg; "Jin-woo, please get some rest now." the man on the right said, concern evident in his tone.  The man on the left, his brow furrowed, seemed to be wrestling with a thought. "Wasn't that all your fault?" he muttered, suspicion lacing his words. 
41.40.A.0.jpg;  "Why do you always move away from the safe road and dance with death on every occasion?" the man with the dark jacket barked, his anger palpable. "Isn't it a great fortune?" he challenged. 
41.40.A.1.jpg; "Great fortune that an E-Rank Hunter like you was able to grow this much?"  the man in the shadows inquired, his hand raised, weapon in sight.  "Isn't that right?" he finished, his tone laced with a chilling curiosity.  
41.41.A.0.jpg;  "Sung Jin-woo." the words above the young man's head declared, his small smile conveying a quiet confidence, his gaze fixed ahead, his calmness a testament to the strength he held within.
