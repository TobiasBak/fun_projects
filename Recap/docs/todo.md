# All missing implementations
1. Refactor everything
2. FileInterface file, to handle all file operations. This is a good idea as they are all structured similarly.
3. Gemini clean text method
4. Sentence optimizers, figure out when things should start with uppercase and when not. 
5. Make a better imagespillet that takes the height and divides instead of the shit it is doing now. Maybe more splitting points or something?
6. Using only one connection to flash model to reduce caching, Give it the picture and the last 10 images sentences. 


## Major steps
1. Thumbnails. (Find best way to do these)
2. Intro to video (Missing video, audio can be generated)
Just needs some refactoring to videoEditing methods, such that an audio file can be given. 
3. Manual upload doc with best settings.

## Improvements
1. Timings to see what is slow
2. Refactor long functions into smaller functions. 
3. Ensure out only contains actual output. (audio, images, subtitles should be moved to temp)

## Conquer the world4
1. Translate to different languages. (Indian, Spanish, Russian, Arabic, etc.)
