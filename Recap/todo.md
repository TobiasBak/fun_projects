# All missing implementations
1. Make sure out only contains concated videos with audio and images
2. Translation does more at a time
3. Update to new versions of gemini api
4. Generate X for X we have, so if we have sentences for 4 languages generate the rest for all 4 languages



## Major steps
1. Thumbnails. (Find best way to do these)
2. Intro to video (Missing video, audio can be generated)
Just needs some refactoring to videoEditing methods, such that an audio file can be given. 
3. Manual upload doc with best settings.

## Improvements
1. Timings to see what is slow
2. Refactor long functions into smaller functions. 
3. Ensure out only contains actual output. (audio, images, subtitles should be moved to temp)

## Conquer the world
1. Translate to different languages. (Indian, Spanish, Russian, Arabic, etc.)
