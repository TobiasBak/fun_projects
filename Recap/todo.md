## Major steps
1. Use AI model for detecting the text in the images. (ScreenReader folder)
The text should be put into txt files, such that the text can be combined with pictures for the final video.
2. AI VoiceOver for the text in the images
3. Combine the images and the voiceover into a video. 
4. Implement a method for combining the videos into a single video.
5. Get AI to narrate what is on the picture / build a story
6. Thumbnails, that are autogenerarted based on language of the video. 

## Improvements
1. Use a background for the video, such that adhd viewers stay
This background could be a rainy forest etc.    
2. Somehow get ai to write a better script by rewritiing the text and getting information from the images.
3. Some images are too large 1.8k+ pixels in height before they are resized. 
Create a script that determines an optimal point somewhere in the middle, where the picture can be split.
A determination could be the amount of white or black pixels in the image at that point in the middle.

## Conquer the world
1. Translate to different languages. (Indian, Spanish, Russian, Arabic, etc.)
