Pretty good descriptions of images:
2.16.C.jpg;       The man has ginger hair and a surprised expression with his mouth wide open. He has a worried look on his face. The man is in the foreground of the image. Above the man's head is text that reads: If The Other Hunters Get To It First, Our Profits Would Dwindle. The text is in text that is above the man's head. The image has a feeling of anxiety and worry.
2.2.A.jpg;     Two hands are holding a bright, glowing sphere in the center of the image. The hands are the focus of the image and the sphere is the most prominent feature. The sphere is surrounded by a white glow and a light, golden background. The hands appear to be pushing on the sphere with significant pressure. The hands are holding the sphere, surrounded by white and light golden backgrounds, which convey a feeling of determination and strength.  The text "Jin-Woo, why are you so adamant on working as a hunter?" is placed above the hands. The text "Fighting like this will only bring even more risks!" is placed below the sphere. The image conveys a sense of tension and seriousness. 
2.4.B.jpg;   A group of people are in a large circular room with a high ceiling. There are golden pillars lining the walls of the room and a broken hole in the ceiling. The ground is covered with large, sharp rocks. A woman is holding a large shield and pointing it at another person. A man wearing a blue shirt and green pants is holding a sword. A large, green creature is running toward the other people. The room is filled with flying debris and bright blue light. A feeling of chaos and intense energy is conveyed in the image.
